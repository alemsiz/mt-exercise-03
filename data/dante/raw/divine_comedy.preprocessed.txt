HELL
OR THE INFERNO
CANTO I
In the midway of this our mortal life ,
I found me in a gloomy wood , astray
Gone from the path direct : and e ’ en to tell
It were no easy task , how savage wild
That forest , how robust and rough its growth ,
Which to remember only , my dismay
Renews , in bitterness not far from death .
Yet to discourse of what there good befell ,
All else will I relate discover ’ d there .
How first I enter ’ d it I scarce can say ,
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh ’ d
My senses down , when the true path I left ,
But when a mountain ’ s foot I reach ’ d , where clos ’ d
The valley , that had pierc ’ d my heart with dread ,
I look ’ d aloft , and saw his shoulders broad
Already vested with that planet ’ s beam ,
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way .
Then was a little respite to the fear ,
That in my heart ’ s recesses deep had lain ,
All of that night , so pitifully pass ’ d :
And as a man , with difficult short breath ,
Forespent with toiling , ’ scap ’ d from sea to shore ,
Turns to the perilous wide waste , and stands
At gaze ; e ’ en so my spirit , that yet fail ’ d
Struggling with terror , turn ’ d to view the straits ,
That none hath pass ’ d and liv ’ d . My weary frame
After short pause recomforted , again
I journey ’ d on over that lonely steep ,
The hinder foot still firmer . Scarce the ascent
Began , when , lo ! a panther , nimble , light ,
And cover ’ d with a speckled skin , appear ’ d ,
Nor , when it saw me , vanish ’ d , rather strove
To check my onward going ; that ofttimes
With purpose to retrace my steps I turn ’ d .
The hour was morning ’ s prime , and on his way
Aloft the sun ascended with those stars ,
That with him rose , when Love divine first mov ’ d
Those its fair works : so that with joyous hope
All things conspir ’ d to fill me , the gay skin
Of that swift animal , the matin dawn
And the sweet season . Soon that joy was chas ’ d ,
And by new dread succeeded , when in view
A lion came , ’ gainst me , as it appear ’ d ,
With his head held aloft and hunger-mad ,
That e ’ en the air was fear-struck . A she-wolf
Was at his heels , who in her leanness seem ’ d
Full of all wants , and many a land hath made
Disconsolate ere now . She with such fear
O ’ erwhelmed me , at the sight of her appall ’ d ,
That of the height all hope I lost . As one ,
Who with his gain elated , sees the time
When all unwares is gone , he inwardly
Mourns with heart-griping anguish ; such was I ,
Haunted by that fell beast , never at peace ,
Who coming o ’ er against me , by degrees
Impell ’ d me where the sun in silence rests .
While to the lower space with backward step
I fell , my ken discern ’ d the form one of one ,
Whose voice seem ’ d faint through long disuse of speech .
When him in that great desert I espied ,
“ Have mercy on me ! ” cried I out aloud ,
“ Spirit ! or living man ! what e ’ er thou be ! ”
He answer ’ d : “ Now not man , man once I was ,
And born of Lombard parents , Mantuana both
By country , when the power of Julius yet
Was scarcely firm . At Rome my life was past
Beneath the mild Augustus , in the time
Of fabled deities and false . A bard
Was I , and made Anchises ’ upright son
The subject of my song , who came from Troy ,
When the flames prey ’ d on Ilium ’ s haughty towers .
But thou , say wherefore to such perils past
Return ’ st thou ? wherefore not this pleasant mount
Ascendest , cause and source of all delight ? ”
“ And art thou then that Virgil , that well-spring ,
From which such copious floods of eloquence
Have issued ? ” I with front abash ’ d replied .
“ Glory and light of all the tuneful train !
May it avail me that I long with zeal
Have sought thy volume , and with love immense
Have conn ’ d it o ’ er . My master thou and guide !
Thou he from whom alone I have deriv ’ d
That style , which for its beauty into fame
Exalts me . See the beast , from whom I fled .
O save me from her , thou illustrious sage !
“ For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
She hath made tremble . ” He , soon as he saw
That I was weeping , answer ’ d , “ Thou must needs
Another way pursue , if thou wouldst ’ scape
From out that savage wilderness . This beast ,
At whom thou criest , her way will suffer none
To pass , and no less hindrance makes than death :
So bad and so accursed in her kind ,
That never sated is her ravenous will ,
Still after food more craving than before .
To many an animal in wedlock vile
She fastens , and shall yet to many more ,
Until that greyhound come , who shall destroy
Her with sharp pain . He will not life support
By earth nor its base metals , but by love ,
Wisdom , and virtue , and his land shall be
The land ’ twixt either Feltro . In his might
Shall safety to Italia ’ s plains arise ,
For whose fair realm , Camilla , virgin pure ,
Nisus , Euryalus , and Turnus fell .
He with incessant chase through every town
Shall worry , until he to hell at length
Restore her , thence by envy first let loose .
I for thy profit pond ’ ring now devise ,
That thou mayst follow me , and I thy guide
Will lead thee hence through an eternal space ,
Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks , and see
Spirits of old tormented , who invoke
A second death ; and those next view , who dwell
Content in fire , for that they hope to come ,
Whene ’ er the time may be , among the blest ,
Into whose regions if thou then desire
T ’ ascend , a spirit worthier than I
Must lead thee , in whose charge , when I depart ,
Thou shalt be left : for that Almighty King ,
Who reigns above , a rebel to his law ,
Adjudges me , and therefore hath decreed ,
That to his city none through me should come .
He in all parts hath sway ; there rules , there holds
His citadel and throne . O happy those ,
Whom there he chooses ! ” I to him in few :
“ Bard ! by that God , whom thou didst not adore ,
I do beseech thee ( that this ill and worse
I may escape ) to lead me , where thou saidst ,
That I Saint Peter ’ s gate may view , and those
Who as thou tell ’ st , are in such dismal plight . ”
Onward he mov ’ d , I close his steps pursu ’ d .
CANTO II
Now was the day departing , and the air ,
Imbrown ’ d with shadows , from their toils releas ’ d
All animals on earth ; and I alone
Prepar ’ d myself the conflict to sustain ,
Both of sad pity , and that perilous road ,
Which my unerring memory shall retrace .
O Muses ! O high genius ! now vouchsafe
Your aid ! O mind ! that all I saw hast kept
Safe in a written record , here thy worth
And eminent endowments come to proof .
I thus began : “ Bard ! thou who art my guide ,
Consider well , if virtue be in me
Sufficient , ere to this high enterprise
Thou trust me . Thou hast told that Silvius ’ sire ,
Yet cloth ’ d in corruptible flesh , among
Th ’ immortal tribes had entrance , and was there
Sensible present . Yet if heaven ’ s great Lord ,
Almighty foe to ill , such favour shew ’ d ,
In contemplation of the high effect ,
Both what and who from him should issue forth ,
It seems in reason ’ s judgment well deserv ’ d :
Sith he of Rome , and of Rome ’ s empire wide ,
In heaven ’ s empyreal height was chosen sire :
Both which , if truth be spoken , were ordain ’ d
And ’ stablish ’ d for the holy place , where sits
Who to great Peter ’ s sacred chair succeeds .
He from this journey , in thy song renown ’ d ,
Learn ’ d things , that to his victory gave rise
And to the papal robe . In after-times
The chosen vessel also travel ’ d there ,
To bring us back assurance in that faith ,
Which is the entrance to salvation ’ s way .
But I , why should I there presume ? or who
Permits it ? not Aeneas I nor Paul .
Myself I deem not worthy , and none else
Will deem me . I , if on this voyage then
I venture , fear it will in folly end .
Thou , who art wise , better my meaning know ’ st ,
Than I can speak . ” As one , who unresolves
What he hath late resolv ’ d , and with new thoughts
Changes his purpose , from his first intent
Remov ’ d ; e ’ en such was I on that dun coast ,
Wasting in thought my enterprise , at first
So eagerly embrac ’ d . “ If right thy words
I scan , ” replied that shade magnanimous ,
“ Thy soul is by vile fear assail ’ d , which oft
So overcasts a man , that he recoils
From noblest resolution , like a beast
At some false semblance in the twilight gloom .
That from this terror thou mayst free thyself ,
I will instruct thee why I came , and what
I heard in that same instant , when for thee
Grief touch ’ d me first . I was among the tribe ,
Who rest suspended , when a dame , so blest
And lovely , I besought her to command ,
Call ’ d me ; her eyes were brighter than the star
Of day ; and she with gentle voice and soft
Angelically tun ’ d her speech address ’ d :
“ O courteous shade of Mantua ! thou whose fame
Yet lives , and shall live long as nature lasts !
A friend , not of my fortune but myself ,
On the wide desert in his road has met
Hindrance so great , that he through fear has turn ’ d .
Now much I dread lest he past help have stray ’ d ,
And I be ris ’ n too late for his relief ,
From what in heaven of him I heard . Speed now ,
And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue ,
And by all means for his deliverance meet ,
Assist him . So to me will comfort spring .
I who now bid thee on this errand forth
Am Beatrice ; from a place I come .
( Note : Beatrice . I use this word , as it is
pronounced in the Italian , as consisting of four
syllables , of which the third is a long one . ) Revisited with joy . Love
brought me thence ,
Who prompts my speech . When in my Master ’ s sight
I stand , thy praise to him I oft will tell . ”
She then was silent , and I thus began :
“ O Lady ! by whose influence alone ,
Mankind excels whatever is contain ’ d
Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb ,
So thy command delights me , that to obey ,
If it were done already , would seem late .
No need hast thou farther to speak thy will ;
Yet tell the reason , why thou art not loth
To leave that ample space , where to return
Thou burnest , for this centre here beneath . ”
She then : “ Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire ,
I will instruct thee briefly , why no dread
Hinders my entrance here . Those things alone
Are to be fear ’ d , whence evil may proceed ,
None else , for none are terrible beside .
I am so fram ’ d by God , thanks to his grace !
That any suff ’ rance of your misery
Touches me not , nor flame of that fierce fire
Assails me . In high heaven a blessed dame
Besides , who mourns with such effectual grief
That hindrance , which I send thee to remove ,
That God ’ s stern judgment to her will inclines . ”
To Lucia calling , her she thus bespake :
“ Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
And I commend him to thee . ” At her word
Sped Lucia , of all cruelty the foe ,
And coming to the place , where I abode
Seated with Rachel , her of ancient days ,
She thus address ’ d me : “ Thou true praise of God !
Beatrice ! why is not thy succour lent
To him , who so much lov ’ d thee , as to leave
For thy sake all the multitude admires ?
Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail ,
Nor mark the death , which in the torrent flood ,
Swoln mightier than a sea , him struggling holds ? ”
Ne ’ er among men did any with such speed
Haste to their profit , flee from their annoy ,
As when these words were spoken , I came here ,
Down from my blessed seat , trusting the force
Of thy pure eloquence , which thee , and all
Who well have mark ’ d it , into honour brings . ”
“ When she had ended , her bright beaming eyes
Tearful she turn ’ d aside ; whereat I felt
Redoubled zeal to serve thee . As she will ’ d ,
Thus am I come : I sav ’ d thee from the beast ,
Who thy near way across the goodly mount
Prevented . What is this comes o ’ er thee then ?
Why , why dost thou hang back ? why in thy breast
Harbour vile fear ? why hast not courage there
And noble daring ? Since three maids so blest
Thy safety plan , e ’ en in the court of heaven ;
And so much certain good my words forebode . ”
As florets , by the frosty air of night
Bent down and clos ’ d , when day has blanch ’ d their leaves ,
Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems ;
So was my fainting vigour new restor ’ d ,
And to my heart such kindly courage ran ,
That I as one undaunted soon replied :
“ O full of pity she , who undertook
My succour ! and thou kind who didst perform
So soon her true behest ! With such desire
Thou hast dispos ’ d me to renew my voyage ,
That my first purpose fully is resum ’ d .
Lead on : one only will is in us both .
Thou art my guide , my master thou , and lord . ”
So spake I ; and when he had onward mov ’ d ,
I enter ’ d on the deep and woody way .
CANTO III
“ Through me you pass into the city of woe :
Through me you pass into eternal pain :
Through me among the people lost for aye .
Justice the founder of my fabric mov ’ d :
To rear me was the task of power divine ,
Supremest wisdom , and primeval love .
Before me things create were none , save things
Eternal , and eternal I endure .
“ All hope abandon ye who enter here . ”
Such characters in colour dim I mark ’ d
Over a portal ’ s lofty arch inscrib ’ d :
Whereat I thus : “ Master , these words import
Hard meaning . ” He as one prepar ’ d replied :
“ Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave ;
Here be vile fear extinguish ’ d . We are come
Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
To misery doom ’ d , who intellectual good
Have lost . ” And when his hand he had stretch ’ d forth
To mine , with pleasant looks , whence I was cheer ’ d ,
Into that secret place he led me on .
Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
Resounded through the air pierc ’ d by no star ,
That e ’ en I wept at entering . Various tongues ,
Horrible languages , outcries of woe ,
Accents of anger , voices deep and hoarse ,
With hands together smote that swell ’ d the sounds ,
Made up a tumult , that for ever whirls
Round through that air with solid darkness stain ’ d ,
Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies .
I then , with error yet encompass ’ d , cried :
“ O master ! What is this I hear ? What race
Are these , who seem so overcome with woe ? ”
He thus to me : “ This miserable fate
Suffer the wretched souls of those , who liv ’ d
Without or praise or blame , with that ill band
Of angels mix ’ d , who nor rebellious prov ’ d
Nor yet were true to God , but for themselves
Were only . From his bounds Heaven drove them forth ,
Not to impair his lustre , nor the depth
Of Hell receives them , lest th ’ accursed tribe
Should glory thence with exultation vain . ”
I then : “ Master ! what doth aggrieve them thus ,
That they lament so loud ? ” He straight replied :
“ That will I tell thee briefly . These of death
No hope may entertain : and their blind life
So meanly passes , that all other lots
They envy . Fame of them the world hath none ,
Nor suffers ; mercy and justice scorn them both .
Speak not of them , but look , and pass them by . ”
And I , who straightway look ’ d , beheld a flag ,
Which whirling ran around so rapidly ,
That it no pause obtain ’ d : and following came
Such a long train of spirits , I should ne ’ er
Have thought , that death so many had despoil ’ d .
When some of these I recogniz ’ d , I saw
And knew the shade of him , who to base fear
Yielding , abjur ’ d his high estate . Forthwith
I understood for certain this the tribe
Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
And to his foes . These wretches , who ne ’ er lived ,
Went on in nakedness , and sorely stung
By wasps and hornets , which bedew ’ d their cheeks
With blood , that mix ’ d with tears dropp ’ d to their feet ,
And by disgustful worms was gather ’ d there .
Then looking farther onwards I beheld
A throng upon the shore of a great stream :
Whereat I thus : “ Sir ! grant me now to know
Whom here we view , and whence impell ’ d they seem
So eager to pass o ’ er , as I discern
Through the blear light ? ” He thus to me in few :
“ This shalt thou know , soon as our steps arrive
Beside the woeful tide of Acheron . ”
Then with eyes downward cast and fill ’ d with shame ,
Fearing my words offensive to his ear ,
Till we had reach ’ d the river , I from speech
Abstain ’ d . And lo ! toward us in a bark
Comes on an old man hoary white with eld ,
Crying , “ Woe to you wicked spirits ! hope not
Ever to see the sky again . I come
To take you to the other shore across ,
Into eternal darkness , there to dwell
In fierce heat and in ice . And thou , who there
Standest , live spirit ! get thee hence , and leave
These who are dead . ” But soon as he beheld
I left them not , “ By other way , ” said he ,
“ By other haven shalt thou come to shore ,
Not by this passage ; thee a nimbler boat
Must carry . ” Then to him thus spake my guide :
“ Charon ! thyself torment not : so ’ t is will ’ d ,
Where will and power are one : ask thou no more . ”
Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
Of him the boatman o ’ er the livid lake ,
Around whose eyes glar ’ d wheeling flames . Meanwhile
Those spirits , faint and naked , color chang ’ d ,
And gnash ’ d their teeth , soon as the cruel words
They heard . God and their parents they blasphem ’ d ,
The human kind , the place , the time , and seed
That did engender them and give them birth .
Then all together sorely wailing drew
To the curs ’ d strand , that every man must pass
Who fears not God . Charon , demoniac form ,
With eyes of burning coal , collects them all ,
Beck ’ ning , and each , that lingers , with his oar
Strikes . As fall off the light autumnal leaves ,
One still another following , till the bough
Strews all its honours on the earth beneath ;
E ’ en in like manner Adam ’ s evil brood
Cast themselves one by one down from the shore ,
Each at a beck , as falcon at his call .
Thus go they over through the umber ’ d wave ,
And ever they on the opposing bank
Be landed , on this side another throng
Still gathers . “ Son , ” thus spake the courteous guide ,
“ Those , who die subject to the wrath of God ,
All here together come from every clime ,
And to o ’ erpass the river are not loth :
For so heaven ’ s justice goads them on , that fear
Is turn ’ d into desire . Hence ne ’ er hath past
Good spirit . If of thee Charon complain ,
Now mayst thou know the import of his words . ”
This said , the gloomy region trembling shook
So terribly , that yet with clammy dews
Fear chills my brow . The sad earth gave a blast ,
That , lightening , shot forth a vermilion flame ,
Which all my senses conquer ’ d quite , and I
Down dropp ’ d , as one with sudden slumber seiz ’ d .
CANTO IV
Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash
Of heavy thunder , that I shook myself ,
As one by main force rous ’ d . Risen upright ,
My rested eyes I mov ’ d around , and search ’ d
With fixed ken to know what place it was ,
Wherein I stood . For certain on the brink
I found me of the lamentable vale ,
The dread abyss , that joins a thund ’ rous sound
Of plaints innumerable . Dark and deep ,
And thick with clouds o ’ erspread , mine eye in vain
Explor ’ d its bottom , nor could aught discern .
“ Now let us to the blind world there beneath
Descend ; ” the bard began all pale of look :
“ I go the first , and thou shalt follow next . ”
Then I his alter ’ d hue perceiving , thus :
“ How may I speed , if thou yieldest to dread ,
Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt ? ”
He then : “ The anguish of that race below
With pity stains my cheek , which thou for fear
Mistakest . Let us on . Our length of way
Urges to haste . ” Onward , this said , he mov ’ d ;
And ent ’ ring led me with him on the bounds
Of the first circle , that surrounds th ’ abyss .
Here , as mine ear could note , no plaint was heard
Except of sighs , that made th ’ eternal air
Tremble , not caus ’ d by tortures , but from grief
Felt by those multitudes , many and vast ,
Of men , women , and infants . Then to me
The gentle guide : “ Inquir ’ st thou not what spirits
Are these , which thou beholdest ? Ere thou pass
Farther , I would thou know , that these of sin
Were blameless ; and if aught they merited ,
It profits not , since baptism was not theirs ,
The portal to thy faith . If they before
The Gospel liv ’ d , they serv ’ d not God aright ;
And among such am I. For these defects ,
And for no other evil , we are lost ;
“ Only so far afflicted , that we live
Desiring without hope . ” So grief assail ’ d
My heart at hearing this , for well I knew
Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
Of mighty worth . “ O tell me , sire rever ’ d !
Tell me , my master ! ” I began through wish
Of full assurance in that holy faith ,
Which vanquishes all error ; “ say , did e ’ er
Any , or through his own or other ’ s merit ,
Come forth from thence , whom afterward was blest ? ”
Piercing the secret purport of my speech ,
He answer ’ d : “ I was new to that estate ,
When I beheld a puissant one arrive
Amongst us , with victorious trophy crown ’ d .
He forth the shade of our first parent drew ,
Abel his child , and Noah righteous man ,
Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv ’ d ,
Of patriarch Abraham , and David king ,
Israel with his sire and with his sons ,
Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won ,
And others many more , whom he to bliss
Exalted . Before these , be thou assur ’ d ,
No spirit of human kind was ever sav ’ d . ”
We , while he spake , ceas ’ d not our onward road ,
Still passing through the wood ; for so I name
Those spirits thick beset . We were not far
On this side from the summit , when I kenn ’ d
A flame , that o ’ er the darken ’ d hemisphere
Prevailing shin ’ d . Yet we a little space
Were distant , not so far but I in part
Discover ’ d , that a tribe in honour high
That place possess ’ d . “ O thou , who every art
And science valu ’ st ! who are these , that boast
Such honour , separate from all the rest ? ”
He answer ’ d : “ The renown of their great names
That echoes through your world above , acquires
Favour in heaven , which holds them thus advanc ’ d . ”
Meantime a voice I heard : “ Honour the bard
Sublime ! his shade returns that left us late ! ”
No sooner ceas ’ d the sound , than I beheld
Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps ,
Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad .
When thus my master kind began : “ Mark him ,
Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen ,
The other three preceding , as their lord .
This is that Homer , of all bards supreme :
Flaccus the next in satire ’ s vein excelling ;
The third is Naso ; Lucan is the last .
Because they all that appellation own ,
With which the voice singly accosted me ,
Honouring they greet me thus , and well they judge . ”
So I beheld united the bright school
Of him the monarch of sublimest song ,
That o ’ er the others like an eagle soars .
When they together short discourse had held ,
They turn ’ d to me , with salutation kind
Beck ’ ning me ; at the which my master smil ’ d :
Nor was this all ; but greater honour still
They gave me , for they made me of their tribe ;
And I was sixth amid so learn ’ d a band .
Far as the luminous beacon on we pass ’ d
Speaking of matters , then <unk> well
To speak , now fitter left untold . At foot
Of a <unk> castle we arriv ’ d ,
Seven times with lofty walls <unk> , and round
<unk> by a pleasant stream . O ’ er this
As o ’ er dry land we pass ’ d . Next through seven gates
I with those sages enter ’ d , and we came
Into a <unk> with lively verdure fresh .
There dwelt a race , who slow their eyes around
<unk> mov ’ d , and in their port
<unk> eminent authority ; they spake
<unk> , but all their words were tuneful sweet .
We to one side retir ’ d , into a place
Open and bright and lofty , whence each one
Stood manifest to view . <unk>
There on the green enamel of the plain
Were shown me the great spirits , by whose sight
I am exalted in my own <unk> .
<unk> there I saw accompanied
By many , among whom <unk> I knew ,
Anchises ’ pious son , and with hawk ’ s eye
Caesar all arm ’ d , and by Camilla there
<unk> . On the other side
Old King <unk> , seated by his child
Lavinia , and that Brutus I beheld ,
Who <unk> chas ’ d , <unk> , Cato ’ s wife
Marcia , with <unk> and <unk> there ;
And sole apart retir ’ d , the Soldan fierce .
Then when a little more I rais ’ d my brow ,
I spied the master of the sapient throng ,
Seated amid the <unk> train .
Him all admire , all pay him rev ’ rence due .
There <unk> and Plato both I mark ’ d ,
Nearest to him in rank ; <unk> ,
Who sets the world at chance , <unk> ,
With <unk> , and <unk> ,
And <unk> , and <unk> sage ,
Zeno , and <unk> well read
In nature ’ s secret lore . <unk> I mark ’ d
And <unk> , <unk> and moral <unk> ,
<unk> and <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> , <unk> , and him who made
That <unk> vast , <unk> .
Of all to speak at full were vain attempt ;
For my wide theme so <unk> , that ofttimes
My words fall short of what bechanc ’ d . In two
The six associates part . Another way
My sage guide leads me , from that air serene ,
Into a <unk> ever vex ’ d with storms :
And to a part I come where no light shines .
CANTO V
From the first circle I descended thus
Down to the second , which , a lesser space
Embracing , so much more of grief contains
<unk> bitter moans . There , Minos stands
<unk> with ghastly feature : he , of all
Who enter , strict <unk> the crimes ,
Gives sentence , and <unk> them beneath ,
According as he <unk> him around :
For when before him comes th ’ ill <unk> soul ,
It all confesses ; and that judge severe
Of sins , <unk> what place in hell
Suits the transgression , with his tail so oft
Himself <unk> , as degrees beneath
He dooms it to descend . Before him stand
<unk> a num ’ rous throng ; and in his turn
Each one to judgment passing , speaks , and hears
His fate , thence downward to his dwelling hurl ’ d .
“ O thou ! who to this residence of woe
<unk> ? ” when he saw me coming , cried
Minos , <unk> his dread employ ,
“ Look how thou enter here ; beware in whom
Thou place thy trust ; let not the entrance broad
<unk> thee to thy harm . ” To him my guide :
“ Wherefore <unk> ? <unk> not his way
By destiny <unk> ; so ’ tis will ’ d
Where will and power are one . Ask thou no more . ”
Now ’ <unk> the rueful wailings to be heard .
Now am I come where many a <unk> voice
Smites on mine ear . Into a place I came
Where light was silent all . <unk> there groan ’ d
A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By <unk> winds . The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirl ’ d round and dash ’ d amain with sore annoy .
When they arrive before the <unk> sweep ,
There shrieks are heard , there lamentations , moans ,
And <unk> ’ gainst the good Power in heaven .
I understood that to this torment sad
The <unk> sinners are condemn ’ d , in whom
<unk> by lust is sway ’ d . As in large troops
And <unk> , when winter reigns ,
The <unk> on their wings are borne abroad ;
So bears the <unk> gust those evil souls .
On this side and on that , above , below ,
It drives them : hope of rest to solace them
Is none , nor e ’ en of milder pang . As cranes ,
<unk> their <unk> ’ rous notes , traverse the sky ,
Stretch ’ d out in long <unk> : so I beheld
Spirits , who came loud wailing , hurried on
By their dire doom . Then I : “ Instructor ! who
Are these , by the black air so <unk> ’ d ? ” — “ The first
’ <unk> those , of whom thou question ’ st , ” he replied ,
“ O ’ er many tongues was <unk> . She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless , that she made
<unk> be lawful by <unk> ’ d decree ,
To clear the blame she had herself incurr ’ d .
This is <unk> , of whom ’ tis writ ,
That she succeeded <unk> her espous ’ d ;
And held the land , which now the Soldan rules .
The next in amorous fury slew herself ,
And to <unk> ’ ashes broke her faith :
Then follows <unk> , lustful queen . ”
There mark ’ d I <unk> , for whose sake so long
The time was <unk> with evil ; there the great
Achilles , who with love fought to the end .
Paris I saw , and <unk> ; and beside
A thousand more he show ’ d me , and by name
Pointed them out , whom love bereav ’ d of life .
When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of <unk> days , o ’ erpower ’ d
By pity , <unk> in amaze my mind
Was lost ; and I began : “ Bard ! willingly
I would address those two together coming ,
Which seem so light before the wind . ” He thus :
“ Note thou , when nearer they to us approach .
“ Then by that love which carries them along ,
Entreat ; and they will come . ” Soon as the wind
Sway ’ d them toward us , I thus fram ’ d my speech :
“ O wearied spirits ! come , and hold discourse
With us , if by none else restrain ’ d . ” As <unk>
By fond desire invited , on wide wings
And firm , to their sweet nest returning home ,
<unk> the air , wafted by their will along ;
Thus issu ’ d from that troop , where <unk> ranks ,
They through the ill air speeding ; with such force
My cry prevail ’ d by strong affection urg ’ d .
“ O gracious creature and benign ! who go ’ st
<unk> , through this element obscure ,
Us , who the world with bloody stain imbru ’ d ;
If for a friend the King of all we own ’ d ,
Our pray ’ r to him should for thy peace arise ,
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight .
Of whatsoe ’ er to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee , that will we hear , of that
Freely with thee discourse , while e ’ er the wind ,
As now , is mute . The land , that gave me birth ,
Is <unk> on the coast , where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his <unk> streams .
“ Love , that in gentle heart is quickly learnt ,
<unk> him by that fair form , from me
Ta ’ en in such cruel sort , as grieves me still :
Love , that denial takes from none belov ’ d ,
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well ,
That , as thou see ’ st , he yet <unk> me not .
“ Love brought us to one death : Caina waits
The soul , who <unk> our life . ” Such were their words ;
At hearing which downward I bent my looks ,
And held them there so long , that the bard cried :
“ What art thou pond ’ ring ? ” I in answer thus :
“ <unk> ! by what sweet thoughts , what fond desire
Must they at length to that ill pass have reach ’ d ! ”
Then turning , I to them my speech address ’ d .
And thus began : “ <unk> ! your sad fate
Even to tears my grief and pity moves .
But tell me ; in the time of your sweet sighs ,
By what , and how love granted , that ye knew
Your yet uncertain wishes ? ” She replied :
“ No greater grief than to remember days
Of joy , when mis ’ ry is at hand ! That <unk>
Thy learn ’ d instructor . Yet so eagerly
If thou art bent to know the primal root ,
From whence our love <unk> being , I will do ,
As one , who <unk> and tells his tale . One day
For our delight we read of <unk> ,
How him love thrall ’ d . Alone we were , and no
<unk> near us . Ofttimes by that reading
Our eyes were drawn together , and the hue
Fled from our alter ’ d cheek . But at one point
Alone we fell . When of that smile we read ,
The wished smile , <unk> kiss ’ d
By one so deep in love , then he , who ne ’ er
From me shall separate , at once my lips
All trembling kiss ’ d . The book and <unk> both
Were love ’ s <unk> . In its leaves that day
We read no more . ” While thus one spirit spake ,
The other wail ’ d so sorely , that <unk>
I through compassion fainting , seem ’ d not far
From death , and like a corpse fell to the ground .
CANTO VI
My sense reviving , that erewhile had droop ’ d
With pity for the kindred shades , whence grief
O ’ <unk> me wholly , straight around I see
New torments , new tormented souls , which way
<unk> ’ er I move , or turn , or bend my sight .
In the third circle I arrive , of show ’ rs
<unk> , accursed , heavy , and cold , <unk> ’ d
For ever , both in kind and in degree .
Large hail , <unk> ’ d water , <unk> <unk>
Through the dun midnight air stream ’ d down amain :
<unk> all the land whereon that tempest fell .
Cerberus , cruel monster , fierce and strange ,
Through his wide threefold throat <unk> as a dog
Over the multitude immers ’ d beneath .
His eyes <unk> crimson , black his unctuous beard ,
His belly large , and <unk> ’ d the hands , with which
He tears the spirits , <unk> them , and their limbs
<unk> disparts . <unk> there spread , as curs ,
Under the <unk> <unk> , with one side
The other <unk> , oft they roll them round ,
A wretched , <unk> crew . When that great worm
<unk> us , savage Cerberus , he op ’ d
His jaws , and the fangs show ’ d us ; not a limb
Of him but trembled . Then my guide , his palms
Expanding on the ground , thence <unk> with earth
Rais ’ d them , and cast it in his ravenous maw .
E ’ en as a dog , that <unk> <unk> for food
His keeper , when the <unk> comes , lets fall
His fury , bent alone with eager haste
To swallow it ; so dropp ’ d the loathsome cheeks
Of demon Cerberus , who thund ’ ring <unk>
The spirits , that they for <unk> wish in vain .
We , o ’ er the shades <unk> prostrate by the <unk>
Of the heavy tempest passing , set our feet
Upon their emptiness , that substance seem ’ d .
They all along the earth extended lay
Save one , that sudden rais ’ d himself to sit ,
Soon as that way he saw us pass . “ O thou ! ”
He cried , “ who through the infernal shades art led ,
<unk> , if again thou know ’ st me . Thou wast fram ’ d
Or ere my frame was broken . ” I replied :
“ The anguish thou endur ’ st perchance so takes
Thy form from my remembrance , that it seems
As if I saw thee never . But inform
Me who thou art , that in a place so sad
Art set , and in such torment , that although
Other be greater , more disgustful none
Can be imagin ’ d . ” He in answer thus :
“ Thy city heap ’ d with envy to the <unk> ,
Ay that the measure <unk> its bounds ,
Held me in brighter days . Ye citizens
Were wont to name me Ciacco . For the sin
Of <unk> ’ <unk> , <unk> vice , beneath this rain ,
E ’ en as thou see ’ st , I with <unk> am worn ;
Nor I sole spirit in this woe : all these
Have by like crime incurr ’ d like punishment . ”
No more he said , and I my speech resum ’ d :
“ Ciacco ! thy dire affliction grieves me much ,
Even to tears . But tell me , if thou know ’ st ,
What shall at length befall the citizens
Of the <unk> city ; whether any just one
Inhabit there : and tell me of the cause ,
Whence <unk> <unk> hath assail ’ d it thus ? ”
He then : “ After long striving they will come
To blood ; and the wild party from the woods
Will chase the other with much injury forth .
Then it behoves , that this must fall , within
Three <unk> circles ; and the other rise
By borrow ’ d force of one , who under shore
Now rests . It shall a long space hold aloof
Its forehead , keeping under heavy weight
The other oppress ’ d , <unk> at the load ,
And <unk> sore . The just are two in number ,
But they neglected . Av ’ rice , envy , pride ,
Three fatal sparks , have set the hearts of all
On fire . ” Here ceas ’ d the lamentable sound ;
And I <unk> ’ d thus : “ Still would I learn
More from thee , farther parley still entreat .
Of Farinata and <unk> say ,
They who so well deserv ’ d , of <unk> ,
<unk> , Mosca , and the rest , who bent
Their minds on working good . Oh ! tell me where
They bide , and to their knowledge let me come .
For I am press ’ d with keen desire to hear ,
If heaven ’ s sweet cup or <unk> <unk> of hell
Be to their lip assign ’ d . ” He answer ’ d straight :
“ These are yet <unk> spirits . Various crimes
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss .
If thou so far <unk> , thou mayst see them .
But to the pleasant world when thou return ’ st ,
Of me make mention , I entreat thee , there .
No more I tell thee , answer thee no more . ”
This said , his fixed eyes he turn ’ d askance ,
A little ey ’ d me , then bent down his head ,
And ’ midst his blind companions with it fell .
When thus my guide : “ No more his bed he leaves ,
Ere the last <unk> blow . The Power
Adverse to these shall then in glory come ,
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb <unk> ,
<unk> his fleshly vesture and his form ,
And hear the eternal doom <unk> rend
The vault . ” So pass ’ d we through that mixture foul
Of spirits and rain , with tardy steps ; meanwhile
<unk> , though <unk> , on the life to come .
For thus I question ’ d : “ Shall these tortures , Sir !
When the great sentence passes , be increas ’ d ,
Or <unk> , or as now severe ? ”
He then : “ <unk> thy knowledge ; that <unk>
That as each thing to more perfection grows ,
It feels more sensibly both good and pain .
Though ne ’ er to true perfection may arrive
This race accurs ’ d , yet nearer then than now
They shall approach it . ” <unk> that path
<unk> we <unk> , and discourse
Much more than I relate between us pass ’ d :
Till at the point , where the steps led below ,
Arriv ’ d , there Plutus , the great foe , we found .
CANTO VII
“ Ah me ! O Satan ! Satan ! ” loud exclaim ’ d
Plutus , in accent hoarse of wild alarm :
And the kind sage , whom no event surpris ’ d ,
To comfort me thus spake : “ Let not thy fear
<unk> thee , for power in him , be sure , is none
To hinder down this rock thy safe descent . ”
Then to that sworn lip turning , “ Peace ! ” he cried ,
“ Curs ’ d wolf ! thy fury inward on thyself
Prey , and <unk> thee ! Through the dark profound
Not without cause he passes . So ’ t is will ’ d
On high , there where the great <unk> pour ’ d
Heav ’ n ’ s vengeance on the first <unk> proud . ”
As sails full spread and <unk> with the wind
<unk> suddenly <unk> ’ d , if the mast split ;
So to the ground down dropp ’ d the cruel fiend .
Thus we , descending to the fourth steep <unk> ,
<unk> ’ d on the dismal shore , that all the woe
<unk> in of all the universe . Ah me !
Almighty Justice ! in what store thou heap ’ st
New pains , new <unk> , as I here beheld !
Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this ?
E ’ en as a billow , on <unk> rising ,
Against encounter ’ d billow dashing breaks ;
Such is the dance this wretched race must lead ,
Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found ,
From one side and the other , with loud voice ,
Both roll ’ d on <unk> by main <unk> of their <unk> ,
Then smote together , and each one forthwith
Roll ’ d them back voluble , turning again ,
Exclaiming these , “ Why <unk> thou so fast ? ”
Those answering , “ And why <unk> thou away ? ”
So still <unk> their despiteful song ,
They to the opposite point on either hand
<unk> ’ d the horrid circle : then arriv ’ d ,
Both turn ’ d them round , and through the middle space
<unk> met again . At sight whereof
I , stung with grief , thus spake : “ O say , my guide !
What race is this ? Were these , whose heads are shorn ,
On our left hand , all sep ’ rate to the church ? ”
He straight replied : “ In their first life these all
In mind were so distorted , that they made ,
According to due measure , of their wealth ,
No use . This clearly from their words <unk> ,
Which they <unk> forth , at each extremity
Arriving of the circle , where their crime
<unk> in kind disparts them . To the church
Were separate those , that with no <unk> <unk>
Are crown ’ d , both <unk> and <unk> , o ’ er whom
Av ’ rice <unk> absolute <unk> . ”
I then : “ Mid such as these some needs must be ,
Whom I shall <unk> , that with the blot
Of these foul sins were stain ’ d . ” He answering thus :
“ <unk> thought conceiv ’ st thou . That ignoble life ,
Which made them vile before , now makes them dark ,
And to all knowledge <unk> .
<unk> they shall meet in this <unk> <unk> :
These from the tomb with <unk> grasp shall rise ,
Those with <unk> locks . That ill they gave ,
And ill they kept , hath of the beauteous world
Depriv ’ d , and set them at this strife , which needs
No labour ’ d phrase of mine to set it off .
Now may ’ st thou see , my son ! how brief , how vain ,
The <unk> committed into fortune ’ s hands ,
For which the human race keep such a <unk> !
Not all the gold , that is beneath the moon ,
Or ever hath been , of these <unk> souls
Might <unk> rest for one . ” I thus rejoin ’ d :
“ My guide ! of thee this also would I learn ;
This fortune , that thou speak ’ st of , what it is ,
Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world ? ”
He thus : “ O beings blind ! what ignorance
<unk> you ? Now my judgment hear and mark .
He , whose transcendent wisdom passes all ,
The heavens creating , gave them <unk> powers
To guide them , so that each part shines to each ,
Their light in equal <unk> pour ’ d .
By similar <unk> he ordain ’ d
Over the world ’ s bright images to rule
<unk> of a <unk> hand
And general minister , which at due time
May change the empty <unk> of life
From race to race , from one to other ’ s blood ,
Beyond <unk> of man ’ s <unk> care :
Wherefore one nation rises into sway ,
Another <unk> , e ’ en as her will
Decrees , from us conceal ’ d , as in the grass
The serpent train . Against her nought avails
Your utmost wisdom . She with foresight <unk> ,
<unk> , and carries on her reign , as theirs
The other powers divine . Her <unk> know
None <unk> : by necessity
She is made swift , so frequent come who <unk>
<unk> in her <unk> . This is she ,
So <unk> e ’ en by those , whose debt
To her is rather praise ; they <unk>
With blame requite her , and with evil word ;
But she is blessed , and for that <unk> not :
Amidst the other primal beings glad
Rolls on her sphere , and in her bliss <unk> .
Now on our way pass we , to <unk> woe
Descending : for each star is falling now ,
That mounted at our entrance , and forbids
Too long our tarrying . ” We the circle cross ’ d
To the next steep , arriving at a well ,
That boiling pours itself down to a foss
<unk> ’ d from its source . Far murkier was the wave
Than sablest grain : and we in company
Of the <unk> waters , journeying by their side ,
Enter ’ d , though by a different track , beneath .
Into a lake , the Stygian nam ’ d , <unk>
The dismal stream , when it hath reach ’ d the foot
Of the <unk> wither ’ d cliffs . Intent I stood
To gaze , and in the <unk> sunk descried
A miry tribe , all naked , and with looks
<unk> ’ ning rage . They with their hands alone
Struck not , but with the head , the breast , the feet ,
Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs .
The good instructor spake ; “ Now seest thou , son !
The souls of those , whom anger overcame .
This too for certain know , that underneath
The water dwells a multitude , whose sighs
Into these <unk> make the surface heave ,
As thine eye tells thee <unk> ’ er it turn .
Fix ’ d in the <unk> they say : ‘ Sad once were we
In the sweet air made <unk> by the sun ,
Carrying a foul and lazy mist within :
Now in these murky <unk> are we sad . ’
Such dolorous strain they <unk> in their <unk> .
But word distinct can utter none . ” Our route
Thus <unk> ’ d we , a <unk> widely stretch ’ d
Between the dry <unk> , and the <unk>
Of the loath ’ d pool , turning meanwhile our eyes
Downward on those who <unk> ’ d its muddy <unk> ;
Nor stopp ’ d , till to a tower ’ s low base we came .
CANTO VIII
My theme pursuing , I relate that ere
We reach ’ d the lofty <unk> ’ s base , our eyes
Its height ascended , where two <unk> hung
We mark ’ d , and from afar another light
Return the signal , so remote , that scarce
The eye could <unk> its beam . I turning round
To the deep source of knowledge , thus inquir ’ d :
“ Say what this means ? and what that other light
In answer set ? what <unk> doth this ? ”
“ There on the filthy waters , ” he replied ,
“ E ’ en now what next awaits us mayst thou see ,
If the <unk> ’ d fog conceal it not . ”
Never was arrow from the cord dismiss ’ d ,
That ran its way so nimbly through the air ,
As a small bark , that through the waves I spied
Toward us coming , under the sole sway
Of one that <unk> it , who cried aloud :
“ Art thou arriv ’ d , fell spirit ? ” — “ Phlegyas , Phlegyas ,
This time thou criest in vain , ” my lord replied ;
“ No longer shalt thou have us , but while o ’ er
The <unk> pool we pass . ” As one who hears
Of some great wrong he hath sustain ’ d , whereat
<unk> he pines ; so Phlegyas inly pin ’ d
In his fierce ire . My guide descending stepp ’ d
Into the skiff , and bade me enter next
Close at his side ; nor till my entrance seem ’ d
The vessel freighted . Soon as both <unk> ’ d ,
Cutting the waves , goes on the ancient prow ,
More deeply than with others it is wont .
While we our course o ’ er the dead channel held .
One drench ’ d in mire before me came , and said ;
“ Who art thou , that thou <unk> ere thine hour ? ”
I answer ’ d : “ Though I come , I tarry not ;
But who art thou , that art <unk> so foul ? ”
“ One , as thou seest , who mourn : ” he straight replied .
To which I thus : “ In mourning and in woe ,
Curs ’ d spirit ! tarry thou . I know thee well ,
E ’ en thus in filth disguis ’ d . ” Then stretch ’ d he forth
<unk> to the bark ; whereof my teacher sage
<unk> , thrusting him back : “ Away ! down there ,
“ To the other dogs ! ” then , with his arms my neck
<unk> , kiss ’ d my cheek , and spake : “ O soul
<unk> disdainful ! blest was she in whom
Thou was conceiv ’ d ! He in the world was one
For <unk> noted ; to his memory
No virtue <unk> its lustre ; even so
Here is his shadow furious . There above
How many now hold themselves mighty kings
Who here like swine shall <unk> in the mire ,
Leaving behind them horrible <unk> ! ”
I then : “ Master ! him fain would I behold
Whelm ’ d in these <unk> , before we quit the lake . ”
He thus : “ Or ever to thy view the shore
Be offer ’ d , satisfied shall be that wish ,
Which well <unk> <unk> . ” Scarce his words
Were ended , when I saw the miry tribes
Set on him with such violence , that yet
For that render I thanks to God and praise
“ To <unk> <unk> : ” cried they all :
And on himself the <unk> Florentine
Turn ’ d his <unk> fangs . Him here we left ,
Nor speak I of him more . But on mine ear
Sudden a sound of <unk> smote ,
Whereat mine eye <unk> ’ d I sent abroad .
And thus the good instructor : “ Now , my son !
<unk> near the city , that of Dis is nam ’ d ,
With its grave <unk> , a mighty throng . ”
I thus : “ The <unk> already , Sir !
There <unk> in the valley I descry ,
<unk> vermilion , as if they from fire
Had issu ’ d . ” He replied : “ Eternal fire ,
That inward burns , shows them with ruddy flame
<unk> ’ d ; as in this nether hell thou seest . ”
We came within the fosses deep , that moat
This region <unk> . The walls appear ’ d
As they were fram ’ d of iron . We had made
<unk> circuit , ere a place we reach ’ d , where loud
The <unk> cried vehement : “ Go forth !
The entrance is here ! ” Upon the gates I spied
More than a thousand , who of old from heaven
Were hurl ’ d . With <unk> <unk> , “ Who is this , ”
They cried , “ that without death first felt , goes through
The regions of the dead ? ” My sapient guide
Made sign that he for secret parley wish ’ d ;
Whereat their angry scorn <unk> , thus
They spake : “ Come thou alone ; and let him go
Who hath so <unk> enter ’ d this realm .
Alone return he by his witless way ;
If well he know it , let him prove . For thee ,
Here shalt thou tarry , who through clime so dark
Hast been his escort . ” Now bethink thee , reader !
What cheer was mine at sound of those curs ’ d words .
I did believe I never should return .
“ O my lov ’ d guide ! who more than seven times
<unk> hast render ’ d me , and drawn
From peril deep , whereto I stood expos ’ d ,
Desert me not , ” I cried , “ in this extreme .
And if our onward going be denied ,
Together trace we back our steps with speed . ”
My liege , who thither had conducted me ,
Replied : “ Fear not : for of our passage none
Hath power to <unk> us , by such high
<unk> permitted . But do thou
Expect me here ; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
<unk> , and feed with kindly hope , assur ’ d
I will not leave thee in this lower world . ”
This said , departs the sire <unk> ,
And quits me . <unk> I remain
At war ’ twixt will and will not in my thoughts .
I could not hear what terms he offer ’ d them ,
But they <unk> ’ d not long , for all at once
To trial fled within . <unk> ’ d were the gates
By those our <unk> on the breast
Of my liege lord : <unk> he return ’ d
To me with tardy steps . Upon the ground
His eyes were bent , and from his brow eras ’ d
All confidence , while thus with sighs he spake :
“ Who hath denied me these <unk> of woe ? ”
Then thus to me : “ That I am anger ’ d , think
No ground of terror : in this trial I
Shall vanquish , use what arts they may within
For hindrance . This their insolence , not new ,
Erewhile at gate less secret they display ’ d ,
Which still is without bolt ; upon its arch
Thou saw ’ st the deadly scroll : and even now
On this side of its entrance , down the steep ,
Passing the circles , <unk> , comes
One whose strong might can open us this land . ”
CANTO IX
The hue , which <unk> dread on my pale cheeks
<unk> , when I saw my guide turn back ,
<unk> ’ d that from his which newly they had worn ,
And inwardly restrain ’ d it . He , as one
Who listens , stood attentive : for his eye
Not far could lead him through the sable air ,
And the <unk> ’ ring cloud . “ It yet behooves
We win this fight ” — thus he began — “ if not —
Such aid to us is offer ’ d . — Oh , how long
Me seems it , ere the promis ’ d help arrive ! ”
I noted , how the <unk> of his words
<unk> ’ d their beginning ; for the last he spake
<unk> not with the first . But not the less
My fear was at his saying ; <unk> I drew
To import worse perchance , than that he held ,
His mutilated speech . “ Doth ever any
Into this rueful concave ’ s extreme depth
Descend , out of the first degree , whose pain
Is <unk> <unk> of sweet hope ? ”
Thus I inquiring . “ Rarely , ” he replied ,
“ It chances , that among us any makes
This journey , which I <unk> . Erewhile ’ tis true
Once came I here beneath , conjur ’ d by fell
<unk> , <unk> , who compell ’ d the shades
<unk> to their bodies . No long space my flesh
Was naked of me , when within these walls
She made me enter , to draw forth a spirit
From out of Judas ’ circle . <unk> place
Is that of all , <unk> , and remov ’ d
<unk> from heav ’ n ’ s <unk> orb . The road
Full well I know : thou therefore rest secure .
That lake , the noisome stench <unk> , round
The city ’ of grief <unk> , which now
We may not enter without rage . ” Yet more
He added : but I hold it not in mind ,
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
Where in an instant I beheld <unk>
At once three <unk> <unk> stain ’ d with blood :
In limb and motion <unk> they seem ’ d ;
Around them <unk> <unk> twisting roll ’ d
Their <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> crept
Instead of hair , and their fierce temples bound .
He knowing well the miserable <unk>
Who tend the queen of endless woe , thus spake :
“ Mark thou each dire <unk> . To the left
This is <unk> ; on the right hand she ,
Who wails , <unk> ; and <unk>
I ’ th ’ midst . ” This said , in silence he remain ’ d
Their breast they each one <unk> tore ; themselves
Smote with their palms , and such shrill clamour rais ’ d ,
That to the bard I <unk> , <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> : so to adamant
Him shall we change ; ” all looking down exclaim ’ d .
“ E ’ en when by Theseus ’ might assail ’ d , we took
No ill revenge . ” “ Turn thyself round , and keep
Thy count ’ nance hid ; for if the <unk> dire
Be shown , and thou shouldst view it , thy return
<unk> would be for ever lost . ” This said ,
Himself my gentle master turn ’ d me round ,
Nor trusted he my hands , but with his own
He also hid me . Ye of intellect
Sound and <unk> , mark well the lore conceal ’ d
Under close texture of the mystic strain !
And now there came o ’ er the <unk> waves
<unk> , terrible , a sound that made
Either shore tremble , as if of a wind
<unk> , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
That ’ gainst some forest <unk> all its might ,
<unk> off the branches , beats them down and <unk>
<unk> ; then onward passing proudly sweeps
Its whirlwind rage , while beasts and shepherds fly .
Mine eyes he loos ’ d , and spake : “ And now direct
Thy <unk> nerve along that ancient foam ,
There , <unk> where the smoke ascends . ” As frogs
Before their foe the serpent , through the wave
<unk> swiftly all , till at the ground each one
Lies on a heap ; more than a thousand spirits
Destroy ’ d , so saw I fleeing before one
Who pass ’ d with <unk> feet the Stygian sound .
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
Oft his left hand forth stretch ’ d , and seem ’ d alone
By that <unk> wearied . I perceiv ’ d
That he was sent from heav ’ n , and to my guide
Turn ’ d me , who signal made that I should stand
<unk> , and bend to him . Ah me ! how full
Of noble anger seem ’ d he ! To the gate
He came , and with his wand touch ’ d it , whereat
Open without impediment it flew .
“ <unk> of heav ’ n ! O abject race and scorn ’ d ! ”
Began he on the horrid <unk> standing ,
“ Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
<unk> in you ? wherefore <unk> you ’ gainst that will
Ne ’ er <unk> of its end , and which so oft
Hath laid on you <unk> of your pangs ?
What profits at the <unk> to but the horn ?
Your Cerberus , if ye remember , hence
Bears still , <unk> ’ d of their hair , his throat and maw . ”
This said , he turn ’ d back o ’ er the filthy way ,
And syllable to us spake none , but wore
The semblance of a man by other care
<unk> , and keenly press ’ d , than thought of him
Who in his presence stands . Then we our steps
Toward that territory mov ’ d , secure
After the hallow ’ d words . We <unk> ’ d
There enter ’ d ; and my mind eager to learn
What state a fortress like to that might hold ,
I soon as enter ’ d throw mine eye around ,
And see on every part <unk> space
<unk> with bitter pain and torment ill .
As where <unk> <unk> on the plains of <unk> ,
Or as at <unk> , near <unk> ’ s gulf ,
That closes Italy and <unk> her bounds ,
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres ;
So was it here , save what in horror here
<unk> ’ d : for ’ midst the <unk> were <unk> flames ,
Wherewith <unk> all throughout they burn ’ d ,
That iron for no craft there <unk> needs .
Their lids all hung suspended , and beneath
From them forth issu ’ d lamentable moans ,
Such as the sad and tortur ’ d well might raise .
I thus : “ Master ! say who are these , <unk> ’ d
Within these <unk> , of whom distinct we hear
The dolorous sighs ? ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ The <unk> are here , accompanied
By every sect their followers ; and much more ,
Than thou believest , tombs are freighted : like
With like is buried ; and the <unk>
Are different in degrees of heat . ” This said ,
He to the right hand turning , on we pass ’ d
Betwixt the afflicted and the <unk> high .
CANTO X
Now by a secret pathway we proceed ,
Between the walls , that hem the region round ,
And the tormented souls : my master first ,
I close behind his steps . “ Virtue supreme ! ”
I thus began ; “ who through these ample orbs
In circuit lead ’ st me , even as thou will ’ st ,
Speak thou , and satisfy my wish . May those ,
Who lie within these sepulchres , be seen ?
Already all the lids are rais ’ d , and none
O ’ er them keeps watch . ” He thus in answer spake
“ They shall be closed all , <unk> they here
From <unk> return ’ d shall come , and bring
Their bodies , which above they now have left .
The <unk> on this part obtain
With <unk> all his followers ,
Who with the body make the spirit die .
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
Both to the question ask ’ d , and to the wish ,
Which thou conceal ’ st in silence . ” I replied :
“ I keep not , guide belov ’ d ! from thee my heart
<unk> , but to shun vain length of words ,
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself . ”
“ O Tuscan ! thou who through the city of fire
Alive art passing , so discreet of speech !
Here please thee stay awhile . Thy utterance
<unk> the place of thy <unk>
To be that noble land , with which perchance
I too <unk> <unk> . ” Sudden that sound
Forth issu ’ d from a vault , whereat in fear
I somewhat closer to my leader ’ s side
Approaching , he thus spake : “ What dost thou ? Turn .
Lo , Farinata , there ! who hath himself
Uplifted : from his girdle upwards all
<unk> ’ d behold him . ” On his face was mine
Already fix ’ d ; his breast and forehead there
<unk> , seem ’ d as in high scorn he held
E ’ en hell . Between the sepulchres to him
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
This warning added : “ See thy words be clear ! ”
He , soon as there I stood at the tomb ’ s foot ,
<unk> ’ d me a space , then in disdainful mood
Address ’ d me : “ Say , what <unk> were thine ? ”
I , willing to obey him , straight reveal ’ d
The whole , nor kept back aught : whence he , his brow
Somewhat uplifting , cried : “ <unk> were they
Adverse to me , my party , and the blood
From whence I sprang : twice therefore I abroad
<unk> ’ d them . ” “ Though driv ’ n out , yet they each time
From all parts , ” answer ’ d I , “ return ’ d ; an art
Which yours have shown , they are not skill ’ d to learn . ”
Then , <unk> forth from the unclosed jaw ,
Rose from his side a shade , high as the chin ,
Leaning , methought , upon its knees uprais ’ d .
It look ’ d around , as eager to explore
If there were other with me ; but perceiving
That fond imagination quench ’ d , with tears
Thus spake : “ If thou through this blind prison go ’ st .
Led by thy lofty genius and profound ,
Where is my son ? and wherefore not with thee ? ”
I straight replied : “ Not of myself I come ,
By him , who there <unk> me , through this clime
Conducted , whom perchance Guido thy son
Had in <unk> . ” Already had his words
And <unk> of punishment read me his name ,
Whence I so fully answer ’ d . He at once
Exclaim ’ d , up <unk> , “ How ! said ’ st thou he <unk> ?
No longer lives he ? Strikes not on his eye
The blessed daylight ? ” Then of some delay
I made ere my reply aware , down fell
Supine , not after forth appear ’ d he more .
Meanwhile the other , great of soul , near whom
I yet was station ’ d , chang ’ d not count ’ nance stern ,
Nor mov ’ d the neck , nor bent his <unk> side .
“ And if , ” <unk> the first discourse ,
“ They in this art , ” he cried , “ small skill have shown ,
That doth torment me more e ’ en than this bed .
But not yet fifty times shall be <unk> ’ d
Her aspect , who reigns here Queen of this realm ,
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art .
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return ,
As thou shalt tell me , why in all their laws ,
Against my kin this people is so fell ? ”
“ The slaughter and great havoc , ” I replied ,
“ That colour ’ d <unk> ’ s flood with crimson stain —
To these impute , that in our hallow ’ d dome
Such orisons ascend . ” <unk> he shook
The head , then thus resum ’ d : “ In that <unk>
I stood not singly , nor without just cause
<unk> should with the rest have stirr ’ d ;
But singly there I stood , when by consent
Of all , Florence had to the ground been raz ’ d ,
The one who <unk> <unk> the deed . ”
“ So may thy lineage find at last repose , ”
I thus <unk> ’ d him , “ as thou solve this knot ,
Which now involves my mind . If right I hear ,
Ye seem to view <unk> , that which time
Leads with him , of the present <unk> ’ d . ”
“ We view , as one who hath an evil sight , ”
He answer ’ d , “ plainly , <unk> far remote :
So much of his large <unk> yet <unk>
The Almighty <unk> ; but when they approach
Or <unk> exist , our intellect
Then wholly fails , nor of your human state
Except what others bring us know we aught .
Hence therefore mayst thou understand , that all
Our knowledge in that instant shall <unk> ,
When on <unk> the <unk> close . ”
Then <unk> of my fault , and by remorse
<unk> , I added thus : “ Now shalt thou say
To him there fallen , that his offspring still
Is to the living join ’ d ; and bid him know ,
That if from answer silent I <unk> ’ d ,
’ <unk> that my thought was <unk> intent
Upon that error , which thy help hath solv ’ d . ”
But now my master <unk> me back
I heard , and with more eager haste besought
The spirit to inform me , who with him
<unk> his lot . He answer thus return ’ d :
“ More than a thousand with me here are laid
Within is Frederick , second of that name ,
And the Lord <unk> , and of the rest
I speak not . ” He , this said , from sight <unk> .
But I my steps towards the ancient bard
<unk> , <unk> on the words
<unk> me such ill . Onward he mov ’ d ,
And thus in going question ’ d : “ Whence the amaze
That holds thy senses wrapt ? ” I satisfied
The inquiry , and the sage enjoin ’ d me straight :
“ Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
To thee <unk> harm ; and note thou this , ”
With his rais ’ d finger bidding me take heed ,
“ When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam ,
Whose bright eye all surveys , she of thy life
The future tenour will to thee unfold . ”
Forthwith he to the left hand turn ’ d his feet :
We left the wall , and tow ’ rds the middle space
Went by a path , that to a valley strikes ;
Which e ’ en thus high exhal ’ d its noisome steam .
CANTO XI
Upon the utmost verge of a high bank ,
By craggy rocks <unk> ’ d round , we came ,
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow ’ d :
And here to shun the horrible excess
Of <unk> <unk> , upward cast
From the profound abyss , behind the <unk>
Of a great <unk> we stood retir ’ d ,
Whereon this scroll I mark ’ d : “ I have in charge
<unk> <unk> , whom <unk> drew
From the right path . — Ere our descent behooves
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
To the dire breath accustom ’ d , afterward
<unk> it not . ” My master thus ; to whom
<unk> I spake : “ Some compensation find
That the time past not wholly lost . ” He then :
“ Lo ! how my thoughts e ’ en to thy wishes tend !
My son ! within these rocks , ” he thus began ,
“ Are three close circles in <unk> plac ’ d ,
As these which now thou <unk> ’ st . Each one is full
Of spirits accurs ’ d ; but that the sight alone
<unk> may suffice thee , listen how
And for what cause in <unk> they abide .
“ Of all <unk> act <unk> ’ d in heaven ,
The end is injury ; and all such end
Either by force or fraud works other ’ s woe
But fraud , because of man <unk> evil ,
To God is more displeasing ; and beneath
The <unk> are therefore doom ’ d to ’ endure
Severer pang . The violent <unk>
All the first circle ; and because to force
Three persons are <unk> , in three rounds
Each within other sep ’ rate is it fram ’ d .
To God , his neighbour , and himself , by man
Force may be offer ’ d ; to himself I say
And his <unk> , as thou soon shalt hear
At full . <unk> , violent death , and <unk> wounds
Upon his neighbour he inflicts ; and wastes
By <unk> , <unk> , and the flames ,
His substance . <unk> , and each one that smites
In malice , plund ’ rers , and all robbers , hence
The torment <unk> of the first round
In different herds . Man can do violence
To himself and his own blessings : and for this
He in the second round must aye deplore
With <unk> penitence his crime ,
Whoe ’ er deprives himself of life and light ,
In <unk> lavishment his <unk> wastes ,
And <unk> there where he should dwell in joy .
To God may force be offer ’ d , in the heart
<unk> and <unk> his high power ,
And nature with her kindly law <unk> .
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
Sodom and <unk> , and all such as speak
<unk> of the <unk> in their hearts .
“ <unk> , that in every conscience leaves a sting ,
May be by man employ ’ d on one , whose trust
He wins , or on another who <unk>
Strict confidence . Seems as the latter way
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes .
Whence in the second circle have their nest
<unk> , <unk> , flatteries ,
<unk> , falsehood , simony , all who <unk>
To lust , or set their <unk> at <unk> ,
With such vile <unk> as these . The other way
<unk> both Nature ’ s general love , and that
Which thereto added <unk> gives birth
To <unk> faith . Whence in the lesser circle ,
<unk> of the universe , dread seat of Dis ,
The traitor is <unk> consum ’ d . ”
I thus : “ Instructor , clearly thy discourse
<unk> , <unk> the hideous chasm
And its inhabitants with skill exact .
But tell me this : they of the dull , fat pool ,
Whom the rain beats , or whom the tempest drives ,
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet ,
Wherefore within the city <unk> ’ d
Are not these punish ’ d , if God ’ s wrath be on them ?
And if it be not , wherefore in such guise
Are they condemned ? ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ Wherefore in <unk> <unk> thus thy mind ,
Not so accustom ’ d ? or what other thoughts
Possess it ? Dwell not in thy memory
The words , wherein thy <unk> page <unk>
Three <unk> adverse to Heav ’ n ’ s will ,
<unk> ’ <unk> , malice , and mad <unk> ,
And how <unk> the least offends
God , and least guilt incurs ? If well thou note
This judgment , and remember who they are ,
Without these walls to vain repentance doom ’ d ,
Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac ’ d
From these fell spirits , and less <unk> pours
Justice divine on them its vengeance down . ”
“ O <unk> ! who <unk> all imperfect sight ,
Thou so content ’ st me , when thou solv ’ st my doubt ,
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms .
Yet somewhat turn thee back , ” I in these words
<unk> ’ d , “ where thou saidst , that <unk>
<unk> celestial <unk> ; and this knot
<unk> ’ d <unk> . ” He thus made reply :
“ <unk> , to an attentive ear ,
<unk> points out , not in one part alone ,
How <unk> nature takes her course
From the celestial mind and from its art :
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds ,
Not many leaves scann ’ d o ’ er , <unk> well
Thou shalt discover , that your art on her
<unk> follows , as the <unk> treads
In his instructor ’ s step , so that your art
<unk> the name of second in descent
From God . These two , if thou recall to mind
<unk> ’ s holy book , from the beginning
Were the right source of life and <unk>
To human kind . But in another path
The <unk> walks ; and Nature in herself
And in her <unk> thus he sets at nought ,
<unk> elsewhere his hope . But follow now
My steps on forward journey bent ; for now
The Pisces play with <unk> glance
Along the horizon , and the <unk> lies all
O ’ er the <unk> ; and onward there a space
Is our steep passage down the rocky height . ”
CANTO XII
The place where to descend the precipice
We came , was rough as Alp , and on its verge
Such object lay , as every eye would shun .
As is that ruin , which Adice ’ s stream
On this side Trento struck , should ’ ring the wave ,
Or loos ’ d by earthquake or for lack of prop ;
For from the mountain ’ s summit , whence it mov ’ d
To the low level , so the headlong rock
Is shiver ’ d , that some passage it might give
To him who from above would pass ; e ’ en such
Into the chasm was that descent : and there
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch ’ d
The infamy of Crete , <unk> brood
Of the feign ’ d <unk> : and at sight of us
It gnaw ’ d itself , as one with rage <unk> .
To him my guide exclaim ’ d : “ Perchance thou deem ’ st
The King of Athens here , who , in the world
Above , thy death <unk> ’ d . <unk> ! <unk> !
He comes not <unk> ’ d by thy sister ’ s art ,
But to behold your torments is he come . ”
Like to a bull , that with impetuous spring
<unk> , at the moment when the fatal blow
Hath struck him , but <unk> to proceed
<unk> on either side ; so saw I plunge
The <unk> ; whereat the sage exclaim ’ d :
“ Run to the passage ! while he storms , ’ t is well
That thou descend . ” Thus down our road we took
Through those <unk> crags , that oft
Mov ’ d underneath my feet , to weight like theirs
<unk> ’ d . I pond ’ ring went , and thus he spake :
“ Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin ’ d steep ,
<unk> by the brute violence , which I
Have vanquish ’ d now . Know then , that when I erst
Hither descended to the nether hell ,
This rock was not yet fallen . But past doubt
( If well I mark ) not long ere He arrived ,
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
Of the highest circle , then through all its bounds
Such trembling seiz ’ d the deep concave and foul ,
I thought the universe was thrill ’ d with love ,
<unk> , there are who deem , the world hath oft
Been into <unk> turn ’ d : and in that point ,
Here , and elsewhere , that old rock <unk> down .
But fix thine eyes beneath : the river of blood
Approaches , in the which all those are steep ’ d ,
Who have by violence injur ’ d . ” O blind lust !
O <unk> wrath ! who so dost <unk> us on
In the brief life , and in the eternal then
Thus <unk> o ’ erwhelm us . I beheld
An ample foss , that in a bow was bent ,
As circling all the plain ; for so my guide
Had told . Between it and the rampart ’ s base
On trail ran <unk> , with keen <unk> arm ’ d ,
As to the chase they on the earth were wont .
At seeing us descend they each one stood ;
And issuing from the troop , three sped with <unk>
And <unk> weapons chosen first ; of whom
One cried from far : “ Say to what pain ye come
<unk> ’ d , who down this steep have <unk> ? Speak
From whence ye stand , or else the bow I draw . ”
To whom my guide : “ Our answer shall be made
To Chiron , there , when nearer him we come .
Ill was thy mind , thus ever quick and <unk> . ”
Then me he touch ’ d , and spake : “ Nessus is this ,
Who for the fair <unk> died ,
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate .
He in the midst , that on his breast looks down ,
Is the great Chiron who Achilles <unk> ’ d ;
That other <unk> , prone to wrath . ” Around
The foss these go by thousands , <unk> <unk>
At whatsoever spirit <unk> <unk>
From out the blood , more than his guilt allows .
We to those beasts , that rapid <unk> along ,
Drew near , when Chiron took an arrow forth ,
And with the notch push ’ d back his shaggy beard
To the cheek-bone , then his great mouth to view
<unk> , to his fellows thus exclaim ’ d :
“ Are ye aware , that he who comes behind
Moves what he touches ? The feet of the dead
Are not so wont . ” My <unk> guide , who now
Stood near his breast , where the two natures join ,
Thus made reply : “ He is indeed alive ,
And solitary so must needs by me
Be shown the gloomy vale , thereto induc ’ d
By strict necessity , not by delight .
She left her joyful <unk> in the sky ,
Who this new office to my care <unk> ’ d .
He is no robber , no dark spirit I.
But by that virtue , which <unk> my step
To treat so wild a path , grant us , I pray ,
One of thy band , whom we may trust secure ,
Who to the ford may lead us , and convey
<unk> , him mounted on his back ; for he
Is not a spirit that may walk the air . ”
Then on his right breast turning , Chiron thus
To Nessus spake : “ Return , and be their guide .
And if ye chance to cross another troop ,
<unk> them keep aloof . ” Onward we mov ’ d ,
The faithful escort by our side , along
The border of the <unk> flood ,
Whence from those steep ’ d within loud shrieks arose .
Some there I mark ’ d , as high as to their brow
<unk> ’ d , of whom the mighty Centaur thus :
“ These are the souls of tyrants , who were given
To blood and rapine . Here they wail aloud
Their merciless wrongs . Here <unk> dwells ,
And <unk> fell , who many a year
Of woe wrought for fair <unk> . That brow
Whereon the hair so <unk> <unk> ’ ring hangs ,
Is <unk> ; that with <unk> locks
<unk> ’ of Este , in the world destroy ’ d
By his foul <unk> . ” To the bard rever ’ d
I <unk> me round , and thus he spake ; “ Let him
Be to thee now first leader , me but next
To him in rank . ” Then farther on a space
The Centaur paus ’ d , near some , who at the throat
Were <unk> from the wave ; and <unk> us
A spirit by itself apart retir ’ d ,
Exclaim ’ d : “ He in God ’ s bosom smote the heart ,
Which yet is honour ’ d on the bank of <unk> . ”
A race I next espied , who held the head ,
And even all the <unk> above the stream .
’ Midst these I many a face remember ’ d well .
Thus <unk> more and more the blood became ,
So that at last it but imbru ’ d the feet ;
And there our passage lay athwart the foss .
“ As ever on this side the boiling wave
Thou seest <unk> , ” the Centaur said ,
“ So on the other , be thou well assur ’ d ,
It lower still and lower <unk> its bed ,
Till in that part it <unk> join ,
Where ’ t is the lot of <unk> to mourn .
There Heav ’ n ’ s stern justice lays <unk> hand
On Attila , who was the scourge of earth ,
On <unk> , and on <unk> , and <unk>
Tears ever by the seething flood <unk> ’ d
From the Rinieri , of Corneto this ,
<unk> the other nam ’ d , who fill ’ d the ways
With violence and war . ” This said , he turn ’ d ,
And <unk> us , alone repass ’ d the ford .
CANTO XIII
Ere Nessus yet had reach ’ d the other bank ,
We enter ’ d on a forest , where no track
Of steps had worn a way . Not verdant there
The foliage , but of dusky hue ; not light
The boughs and <unk> , but with <unk> <unk> ’ d
And <unk> thick : fruits there were none , but thorns
Instead , with venom fill ’ d . Less sharp than these ,
Less <unk> the <unk> , wherein abide
Those animals , that hate the <unk> ’ d fields ,
Betwixt Corneto and <unk> ’ s stream .
Here the brute Harpies make their nest , the same
Who from the <unk> the <unk> band
Drove with dire <unk> of their future woe .
<unk> are their pennons , of the human form
Their neck and count ’ nance , arm ’ d with talons keen
The feet , and the huge belly <unk> with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood .
The kind instructor in these words began :
“ Ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now
I ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come
Upon the horrid sand : look therefore well
Around thee , and such things thou shalt behold ,
As would my speech <unk> . ” On all sides
I heard sad <unk> breathe , and none could see
From whom they might have issu ’ d . In amaze
Fast bound I stood . He , as it seem ’ d , believ ’ d ,
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceal ’ d ,
And thus his speech resum ’ d : “ If thou <unk> off
A single <unk> from one of those ill plants ,
The thought thou hast conceiv ’ d shall vanish quite . ”
Thereat a little stretching forth my hand ,
From a great <unk> gather ’ d I a branch ,
And straight the trunk exclaim ’ d : “ Why pluck ’ st thou me ? ”
Then as the dark blood <unk> down its side ,
These words it added : “ Wherefore tear ’ st me thus ?
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast ?
Men once were we , that now are <unk> here .
Thy hand might well have <unk> ’ d us , had we been
The souls of serpents . ” As a brand yet green ,
That burning at one end from the other <unk>
A <unk> sound , and <unk> with the wind
That forces out its way , so burst at once ,
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood .
I , <unk> fall the bough , remain ’ d as one
<unk> ’ d by terror , and the sage replied :
“ If he , O injur ’ d spirit ! could have believ ’ d
What he hath seen but in my verse <unk> ’ d ,
He never against thee had stretch ’ d his hand .
But I , because the thing surpass ’ d belief ,
<unk> him to this deed , which even now
Myself I rue . But tell me , who thou wast ;
That , for this wrong to do thee some amends ,
In the upper world ( for thither to return
Is granted him ) thy fame he may revive . ”
“ That pleasant word of thine , ” the trunk replied
“ Hath so <unk> me , that I from speech
<unk> refrain , wherein if I indulge
A little longer , in the <unk> detain ’ d ,
Count it not grievous . I it was , who held
Both keys to Frederick ’ s heart , and turn ’ d the <unk> ,
Opening and <unk> , with a skill so sweet ,
That besides me , into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find .
The faith I bore to my high charge was such ,
It cost me the life-blood that warm ’ d my veins .
The harlot , who ne ’ er turn ’ d her <unk> eyes
From Caesar ’ s <unk> , common vice and <unk>
Of courts , ’ gainst me inflam ’ d the minds of all ;
And to Augustus they so spread the flame ,
That my glad honours chang ’ d to bitter woes .
My soul , disdainful and <unk> , sought
<unk> in death from scorn , and I became ,
Just as I was , unjust toward myself .
By the new roots , which fix this stem , I swear ,
That never faith I broke to my liege lord ,
Who merited such honour ; and of you ,
If any to the world indeed return ,
Clear he from wrong my memory , that lies
Yet prostrate under envy ’ s cruel blow . ”
First somewhat pausing , till the mournful words
Were ended , then to me the bard began :
“ <unk> not the time ; but speak and of him ask ,
If more thou wish to learn . ” Whence I replied :
“ <unk> thou him again of whatsoe ’ er
Will , as thou think ’ st , content me ; for no power
Have I to ask , such pity ’ is at my heart . ”
He thus resum ’ d ; “ So may he do for thee
Freely what thou <unk> , as thou yet
Be pleas ’ d , <unk> ’ d Spirit ! to declare ,
How in these <unk> joints the soul is tied ;
And whether any ever from such frame
Be loosen ’ d , if thou canst , that also tell . ”
Thereat the trunk breath ’ d hard , and the wind soon
<unk> ’ d into sounds <unk> like these ;
<unk> ye shall be answer ’ d . “ When departs
The fierce soul from the body , by itself
Thence torn asunder , to the seventh gulf
By Minos doom ’ d , into the wood it falls ,
No place assign ’ d , but <unk> chance
Hurls it , there <unk> , as a grain of <unk> ,
It rises to a <unk> , <unk> thence
A savage plant . The Harpies , on its leaves
Then feeding , cause both pain and for the pain
A vent to grief . We , as the rest , shall come
For our own spoils , yet not so that with them
We may again be clad ; for what a man
Takes from himself it is not just he have .
Here we perforce shall <unk> them ; and throughout
The dismal <unk> our bodies shall be hung ,
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade . ”
Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
We stood , <unk> farther speech , when us
A noise surpris ’ d , as when a man perceives
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
Of station ’ d watch , who of the beasts and boughs
Loud rustling round him hears . And lo ! there came
Two naked , torn with <unk> , in headlong flight ,
That they before them broke each fan o ’ th ’ wood .
“ Haste now , ” the foremost cried , “ now haste thee death ! ”
The other , as seem ’ d , <unk> of delay
Exclaiming , “ <unk> ! not so bent for speed
Thy sinews , in the <unk> of <unk> ’ s field . ”
And then , for that perchance no longer breath
Suffic ’ d him , of himself and of a <unk>
One group he made . Behind them was the wood
Full of black female <unk> , gaunt and fleet ,
As <unk> that have newly <unk> ’ d the <unk> .
On him , who <unk> down , they <unk> their fangs ,
And having rent him piecemeal bore away
The tortur ’ d limbs . My guide then seiz ’ d my hand ,
And led me to the <unk> , which in vain
Mourn ’ d through its bleeding wounds : “ O <unk>
Of <unk> ’ <unk> ! what avails it thee , ”
It cried , “ that of me thou hast made thy screen ?
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils ? ”
When o ’ er it he had paus ’ d , my master spake :
“ Say who wast thou , that at so many points
Breath ’ st out with blood thy lamentable speech ? ”
He answer ’ d : “ Oh , ye spirits : arriv ’ d in time
To spy the shameful havoc , that from me
My leaves hath sever ’ d thus , gather them up ,
And at the foot of their sad <unk>
<unk> lay them . In that city ’ I dwelt ,
Who for the Baptist her first <unk> chang ’ d ,
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
To work her woe : and if there still remain ’ d not
On Arno ’ s passage some faint glimpse of him ,
Those citizens , who rear ’ d once more her walls
Upon the ashes left by Attila ,
Had labour ’ d without profit of their toil .
I <unk> the fatal <unk> from my own roof . ”
CANTO XIV
Soon as the charity of native land
<unk> in my bosom , I the scatter ’ d leaves
Collected , and to him restor ’ d , who now
Was hoarse with utt ’ rance . To the limit thence
We came , which from the third the second round
<unk> , and where of justice is display ’ d
<unk> horrible . Things then first seen
<unk> to manifest , I tell how next
A plain we reach ’ d , that from its <unk> bed
Each plant <unk> ’ d . The mournful wood waves round
Its garland on all sides , as round the wood
<unk> the sad foss . There , on the very edge ,
Our steps we stay ’ d . It was an <unk> wide
Of <unk> sand and thick , <unk> most
The soil that erst by Cato ’ s foot was trod .
Vengeance of Heav ’ n ! Oh ! how shouldst thou be fear ’ d
By all , who read what here my eyes beheld !
Of naked spirits many a flock I saw ,
All weeping piteously , to different laws
<unk> : for on the earth some lay <unk> ,
Some crouching close were seated , others pac ’ d
<unk> around ; the latter tribe ,
More numerous , those fewer who beneath
The torment lay , but <unk> in their grief .
O ’ er all the sand fell slowly <unk> down
<unk> flakes of fire , as flakes of snow
On Alpine summit , when the wind is <unk> ’ d .
As in the torrid Indian clime , the son
Of <unk> saw upon his <unk> band
Descending , solid flames , that to the ground
Came down : whence he <unk> him with his troop
To <unk> on the soil ; for easier thus
The vapour was extinguish ’ d , while alone ;
So fell the eternal fiery flood , wherewith
The marble glow ’ d underneath , as under <unk>
The <unk> , doubly to <unk> the pain .
<unk> was the play of wretched hands ,
Now this , now that way <unk> , to shake off
The heat , still falling fresh . I thus began :
“ Instructor ! thou who all things <unk> ’ st ,
Except the hardy demons , that rush ’ d forth
To <unk> our entrance at the gate , say who
Is yon huge spirit , that , as seems , <unk> not
The burning , but lies <unk> in proud scorn ,
As by the sultry tempest <unk> ’ d ? ”
Straight he himself , who was aware I ask ’ d
My guide of him , exclaim ’ d : “ Such as I was
When living , dead such now I am . If Jove
<unk> his workman out , from whom in ire
He snatch ’ d the <unk> , that at my last day
<unk> ’ d me , if the rest be weary out
At their black <unk> <unk> by turns
In <unk> , while he cries aloud ;
“ <unk> , help , good <unk> ! ” as erst he cried
In the <unk> warfare , and the <unk>
<unk> he full aim ’ d at me with all his might ,
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge . ”
Then thus my guide , in accent higher rais ’ d
Than I before had heard him : “ <unk> !
Thou art more punish ’ d , in that this thy pride
Lives yet unquench ’ d : no torrent , save thy rage ,
Were to thy fury pain proportion ’ d full . ”
Next turning round to me with milder lip
He spake : “ This of the seven kings was one ,
Who girt the Theban walls with <unk> , and held ,
As still he seems to hold , God in disdain ,
And sets his high <unk> at nought .
But , as I told him , his despiteful mood
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it .
Follow me now ; and look thou set not yet
Thy foot in the <unk> sand , but to the wood
<unk> ever close . ” <unk> on we pass ’ d
To where there <unk> from the forest ’ s bound
A little brook , whose crimson ’ d wave yet lifts
My hair with horror . As the rill , that runs
From <unk> , to be portion ’ d out
Among the sinful women ; so ran this
Down through the sand , its bottom and each bank
<unk> , and either <unk> at its side ,
Whereon I straight perceiv ’ d our passage lay .
“ Of all that I have shown thee , since that gate
We enter ’ d first , whose threshold is to none
<unk> , nought else so worthy of regard ,
As is this river , has thine eye discern ’ d ,
O ’ er which the <unk> volley all is quench ’ d . ”
So spake my guide ; and I him thence besought ,
That having giv ’ n me appetite to know ,
The food he too would give , that hunger crav ’ d .
“ In midst of ocean , ” forthwith he began ,
“ A <unk> country lies , which Crete is nam ’ d ,
Under whose monarch in old times the world
<unk> ’ d pure and chaste . A mountain rises there ,
Call ’ d <unk> , joyous once with leaves and streams ,
<unk> now like a forbidden thing .
It was the spot which <unk> , Saturn ’ s spouse ,
<unk> for the secret <unk> of her son ;
And better to conceal him , <unk> ’ d in <unk>
His infant cries . Within the mount , upright
An ancient form there stands and huge , that turns
His shoulders towards <unk> , and at Rome
As in his mirror looks . Of <unk> gold
His head is shap ’ d , pure silver are the breast
And arms ; thence to the middle is of <unk> .
And downward all beneath <unk> ’ d steel ,
Save the right foot of <unk> ’ s clay , on which
Than on the other more erect he stands ,
Each part except the gold , is rent throughout ;
And from the <unk> tears <unk> , which join ’ d
<unk> to that cave . They in their course
Thus far <unk> down the rock
Form Acheron , and <unk> , and Phlegethon ;
Then by this straiten ’ d channel passing hence
Beneath , e ’ en to the lowest depth of all ,
Form there Cocytus , of whose lake ( thyself
Shall see it ) I here give thee no account . ”
Then I to him : “ If from our world this <unk>
Be thus deriv ’ d ; wherefore to us but now
<unk> it at this edge ? ” He straight replied :
“ The place , thou know ’ st , is round ; and though great part
Thou have already pass ’ d , still to the left
Descending to the nethermost , not yet
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb .
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear ,
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks . ”
Then I again inquir ’ d : “ Where flow the streams
Of Phlegethon and Lethe ? for of one
Thou tell ’ st not , and the other of that shower ,
Thou say ’ st , is form ’ d . ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ <unk> thy questions all well pleas ’ d I hear .
Yet the red seething wave might have resolv ’ d
One thou <unk> . Lethe thou shalt see ,
But not within this hollow , in the place ,
Whither to <unk> themselves the spirits go ,
Whose blame hath been by penitence remov ’ d . ”
He added : “ Time is now we quit the wood .
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
Safe passage , <unk> by the flames ;
For over them all vapour is <unk> . ”
CANTO XV
One of the solid margins bears us now
<unk> ’ d in the mist , that from the stream
<unk> , <unk> o ’ er , and saves from fire
Both <unk> and water . As the <unk> rear
Their mound , ’ twixt Ghent and Bruges , to chase back
The ocean , <unk> his <unk> tide
That drives toward them , or the <unk> theirs
Along the <unk> , to <unk> their <unk>
And castles , ere the <unk> warmth be felt
On <unk> ’ s top ; such were the <unk> ,
So fram ’ d , though not in height or bulk to these
Made equal , by the master , whosoe ’ er
He was , that rais ’ d them here . We from the wood
Were not so far remov ’ d , that turning round
I might not have discern ’ d it , when we met
A troop of spirits , who came beside the pier .
They each one ey ’ d us , as at <unk>
One eyes another under a new moon ,
And toward us sharpen ’ d their sight as keen ,
As an old <unk> at his needle ’ s eye .
Thus <unk> explor ’ d by all the tribe ,
I was agniz ’ d of one , who by the <unk>
Caught me , and cried , “ What wonder have we here ! ”
And I , when he to me outstretch ’ d his arm ,
Intently fix ’ d my ken on his parch ’ d looks ,
That although <unk> ’ d with fire , they hinder ’ d not
But I remember ’ d him ; and towards his face
My hand inclining , answer ’ d : “ Sir ! Brunetto !
“ And art thou here ? ” He thus to me : “ My son !
Oh let it not <unk> thee , if Brunetto
<unk> but a little space with thee
Turn back , and leave his fellows to proceed . ”
I thus to him replied : “ Much as I can ,
I thereto pray thee ; and if thou be willing ,
That I here seat me with thee , I consent ;
His leave , with whom I journey , first obtain ’ d . ”
“ O son ! ” said he , “ whoever of this throng
One instant stops , lies then a hundred years ,
No fan to <unk> him , when the fire
Smites <unk> . Pass thou therefore on . I close
Will at thy garments walk , and then rejoin
My troop , who go mourning their endless doom . ”
I dar ’ d not from the path descend to tread
On equal ground with him , but held my head
Bent down , as one who walks in reverent guise .
“ What chance or destiny , ” thus he began ,
“ Ere the last day <unk> thee here below ?
And who is this , that shows to thee the way ? ”
“ There up aloft , ” I answer ’ d , “ in the life
<unk> , I wander ’ d in a valley lost ,
Before mine age had to its fullness reach ’ d .
But <unk> I left it : then once more
Into that vale returning , him I met ;
And by this path homeward he leads me back . ”
“ If thou , ” he answer ’ d , “ follow but thy star ,
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven :
Unless in fairer days my judgment err ’ d .
And if my fate so early had not chanc ’ d ,
<unk> the heav ’ ns thus <unk> to thee , I
Had gladly giv ’ n thee comfort in thy work .
But that <unk> and malignant race ,
Who in old times came down from Fesole ,
Ay and still <unk> of their rough <unk> ,
Will for thy good deeds shew thee <unk> .
Nor wonder ; for amongst <unk> ’ d <unk>
It suits not the sweet <unk> lay her fruit .
Old fame reports them in the world for blind ,
<unk> , envious , proud . Look to it well :
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways . For thee
Thy fortune hath such honour in <unk> ,
That thou by either party shalt be crav ’ d
With hunger keen : but be the fresh herb far
From the goat ’ s <unk> . The herd of Fesole
May of themselves make litter , not touch the plant ,
If any such yet spring on their rank bed ,
In which the holy seed revives , <unk>
From those true Romans , who still there remain ’ d ,
When it was made the nest of so much ill . ”
“ Were all my wish fulfill ’ d , ” I straight replied ,
“ Thou from the <unk> of man ’ s nature yet
Hadst not been <unk> forth ; for in my mind
Is fix ’ d , and now strikes full upon my heart
The dear , benign , <unk> image , such
As thine was , when so lately thou didst teach me
The way for man to win eternity ;
And how I priz ’ d the lesson , it behooves ,
That , long as life endures , my tongue should speak ,
What of my fate thou tell ’ st , that write I down :
And with another text to comment on
For her I keep it , the celestial dame ,
Who will know all , if I to her arrive .
This only would I have thee clearly note :
That so my conscience have no plea against me ;
Do fortune as she list , I stand prepar ’ d .
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear .
Speed fortune then her wheel , as <unk> her best ,
The <unk> his <unk> ; all things have their course . ”
Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
Turn ’ d himself back , then look ’ d at me and spake :
“ He listens to good purpose who takes note . ”
I not the less still on my way proceed ,
<unk> with Brunetto , and inquire
Who are most known and chief among his tribe .
“ To know of some is well ; ” thus he replied ,
“ But of the rest silence may best <unk> .
Time would not serve us for report so long .
In brief I tell thee , that all these were <unk> ,
Men of great learning and no less renown ,
By one same sin <unk> in the world .
With them is <unk> , and <unk> ’ s son
<unk> herds among that wretched throng :
And , if the wish of so impure a <unk>
Possess ’ d thee , him thou also might ’ st have seen ,
Who by the <unk> ’ servant was <unk> ’ d
From Arno ’ s seat to <unk> , where
His <unk> ’ d <unk> he left . I more would add ,
But must from farther speech and onward way
Alike desist , for yonder I behold
A mist <unk> on the <unk> plain .
A company , with whom I may not sort ,
Approaches . I commend my <unk> to thee ,
Wherein I yet <unk> ; my sole request . ”
This said he turn ’ d , and seem ’ d as one of those ,
Who o ’ er Verona ’ s champain try their speed
For the green mantle , and of them he seem ’ d ,
Not he who loses but who gains the prize .
CANTO XVI
Now came I where the water ’ s din was heard ,
As down it fell into the other round ,
<unk> like the <unk> of swarming bees :
When forth together issu ’ d from a troop ,
That pass ’ d beneath the fierce <unk> storm ,
Three spirits , running swift . They towards us came ,
And each one cried aloud , “ Oh do thou stay !
Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
To be some inmate of our evil land . ”
Ah me ! what wounds I mark ’ d upon their limbs ,
<unk> and old , <unk> by the flames !
E ’ en the remembrance of them grieves me yet .
Attentive to their cry my teacher paus ’ d ,
And turn ’ d to me his visage , and then spake ;
“ Wait now ! our courtesy these merit well :
And were ’ t not for the nature of the place ,
Whence glide the fiery darts , I should have said ,
That haste had better suited thee than them . ”
They , when we stopp ’ d , resum ’ d their ancient wail ,
And soon as they had reach ’ d us , all the three
Whirl ’ d round together in one restless wheel .
As naked <unk> , smear ’ d with <unk> <unk> ,
Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
And vantage , ere in closer strife they meet ;
Thus each one , as he wheel ’ d , his countenance
At me directed , so that opposite
The neck mov ’ d ever to the twinkling feet .
“ If misery of this drear wilderness , ”
Thus one began , “ added to our sad cheer
And <unk> , do call forth scorn on us
And our <unk> , let our great renown
Incline thee to inform us who thou art ,
That dost imprint with living feet <unk> ’ d
The soil of Hell . He , in whose track thou see ’ st
My steps pursuing , naked though he be
And reft of all , was of more high estate
Than thou believest ; <unk> of the chaste
<unk> , him they <unk> call ’ d ,
Who in his <unk> many a noble act
<unk> ’ d , both by his wisdom and his sword .
The other , next to me that beats the sand ,
Is <unk> , name <unk> well ,
In the upper world , of honour ; and myself
Who in this torment do <unk> with them ,
Am <unk> , whom , past doubt , my wife
Of savage temper , more than aught beside
Hath to this evil brought . ” If from the fire
I had been shelter ’ d , down amidst them straight
I then had cast me , nor my guide , I deem ,
Would have restrain ’ d my going ; but that fear
Of the dire burning vanquish ’ d the desire ,
Which made me eager of their wish ’ d embrace .
I then began : “ Not scorn , but grief much more ,
Such as long time alone can cure , your doom
Fix ’ d deep within me , soon as this my lord
<unk> words , whose tenour taught me to expect
That such a race , as ye are , was at hand .
I am a countryman of yours , who still
<unk> have utter ’ d , and have heard
Your deeds and names renown ’ d . Leaving the gall
For the sweet fruit I go , that a sure guide
Hath promis ’ d to me . But behooves , that far
As to the centre first I downward tend . ”
“ So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs , ”
He answer straight return ’ d ; “ and so thy fame
Shine bright , when thou art gone ; as thou shalt tell ,
If courtesy and <unk> , as they wont ,
Dwell in our city , or have vanish ’ d clean ?
For one amidst us late condemn ’ d to wail ,
<unk> , yonder walking with his <unk> ,
<unk> us no little by the news he brings . ”
“ An <unk> multitude and sudden gains ,
<unk> and excess , O Florence ! have in thee
<unk> ’ d , so that now in tears thou mourn ’ st ! ”
Thus cried I with my face uprais ’ d , and they
All three , who for an answer took my words ,
Look ’ d at each other , as men look when truth
Comes to their ear . “ If thou at other times , ”
They all at once rejoin ’ d , “ so easily
<unk> those , who question , happy thou ,
<unk> with words , so apt to speak thy thought !
Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime ,
Returning to behold the radiant stars ,
When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past ,
See that of us thou speak among mankind . ”
This said , they broke the circle , and so swift
Fled , that as <unk> seem ’ d their nimble feet .
Not in so short a time might one have said
“ <unk> , ” as they had vanish ’ d . Straight my guide
<unk> ’ d his track . I follow ’ d ; and small space
Had we pass ’ d onward , when the water ’ s sound
Was now so near at hand , that we had scarce
Heard one another ’ s speech for the loud din .
E ’ en as the river , that holds on its course
<unk> , from the mount of <unk> ,
On the left side of Apennine , toward
The east , which <unk> higher up
They call , ere it descend into the vale ,
At Forli by that name no longer known ,
<unk> o ’ er Saint <unk> , roll ’ d on
From the Alpine summit down a precipice ,
Where space enough to <unk> a thousand spreads ;
Thus downward from a craggy steep we found ,
That this dark wave resounded , <unk> loud ,
So that the ear its clamour soon had <unk> ’ d .
I had a cord that brac ’ d my girdle round ,
Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
The painted <unk> . This when I had all
<unk> ’ d from me ( so my master bade )
I gather ’ d up , and stretch ’ d it forth to him .
Then to the right he turn ’ d , and from the brink
<unk> few paces distant , cast it down
Into the deep abyss . “ And somewhat strange , ”
Thus to myself I spake , “ signal so strange
<unk> , which my guide with earnest eye
Thus follows . ” Ah ! what caution must men use
With those who look not at the deed alone ,
But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill !
“ <unk> shall come , ” he said , “ what I expect ,
Thine eye discover quickly , that whereof
Thy thought is dreaming . ” Ever to that truth ,
Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears ,
A man , if possible , should bar his lip ;
Since , although blameless , he incurs <unk> .
But silence here were vain ; and by these notes
Which now I sing , reader ! I swear to thee ,
So may they favour find to latest times !
That through the gross and murky air I spied
A shape come swimming up , that might have <unk> ’ d
The <unk> heart with wonder , in such guise
As one returns , who hath been down to loose
An <unk> grappled fast against some rock ,
Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies ,
Who upward springing close draws in his feet .
CANTO XVII
“ Lo ! the fell monster with the deadly sting !
Who passes mountains , breaks through <unk> walls
And firm <unk> <unk> , and with his filth
<unk> all the world ! ” Thus me my guide address ’ d ,
And <unk> ’ d him , that he should come to shore ,
Near to the stony <unk> ’ s utmost edge .
Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear ’ d ,
His head and upper part expos ’ d on land ,
But laid not on the shore his bestial train .
His face the semblance of a just man ’ s wore ,
So kind and gracious was its outward cheer ;
The rest was serpent all : two shaggy claws
Reach ’ d to the <unk> , and the back and breast ,
And either side , were painted o ’ er with <unk>
And <unk> . <unk> <unk> more
Nor <unk> nor <unk> e ’ er on cloth of state
With <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
Nor spread Arachne o ’ er her curious <unk> .
As ofttimes a light skiff , <unk> ’ d to the shore ,
Stands part in water , part upon the land ;
Or , as where dwells the greedy German <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> watching for his prey ;
So on the rim , that fenc ’ d the sand with rock ,
<unk> <unk> ’ d the fiend of evil . In the void
Glancing , his tail <unk> ’ d its <unk> fork ,
With sting like <unk> ’ s arm ’ d . Then thus my guide :
“ Now need our way must turn few steps apart ,
Far as to that ill beast , who <unk> there . ”
Thereat toward the right our downward course
We shap ’ d , and , better to escape the flame
And burning <unk> , ten paces on the verge
<unk> . Soon as we to him arrive ,
A little further on mine eye beholds
A tribe of spirits , seated on the sand
Near the wide chasm . Forthwith my master spake :
“ That to the full thy knowledge may <unk>
Of all this round contains , go now , and mark
The mien these wear : but hold not long discourse .
Till thou <unk> , I with him meantime
Will parley , that to us he may vouchsafe
The aid of his strong shoulders . ” Thus alone
Yet forward on the extremity I pac ’ d
Of that seventh circle , where the mournful tribe
Were seated . At the eyes forth <unk> ’ d their pangs .
Against the vapours and the torrid soil
<unk> their shifting hands they <unk> .
Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
Their jaws and feet by turns , when bitten sore
By <unk> , or flies , or <unk> swarming round .
<unk> the visages of some , who lay
Beneath the <unk> of that dolorous fire ,
One of them all I knew not ; but perceiv ’ d ,
That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
With colours and with <unk> various mark ’ d ,
On which it seem ’ d as if their eye did feed .
And when amongst them looking round I came ,
A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought ,
That wore a lion ’ s countenance and port .
Then still my sight pursuing its career ,
Another I beheld , than blood more red .
A <unk> display of <unk> wing than <unk> .
And one , who bore a fat and azure swine
<unk> ’ d on his white <unk> , addressed me thus :
“ What dost thou in this deep ? Go now and know ,
Since yet thou <unk> , that my neighbour here
<unk> on my left shall sit .
A <unk> with these <unk> am I.
Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears , exclaiming
‘ O haste that noble knight ! he who the pouch
With the three <unk> will bring ! ’ ” This said , he writh ’ d
The mouth , and <unk> ’ d the tongue out , like an <unk>
That <unk> his nostrils . I , lest longer stay
He ill might brook , who bade me stay not long ,
Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn ’ d .
My guide already seated on the haunch
Of the fierce animal I found ; and thus
He me <unk> ’ d . “ Be thou stout ; be bold .
Down such a steep flight must we now descend !
<unk> thou before : for that no power the tail
May have to harm thee , I will be i ’ th ’ midst . ”
As one , who hath an <unk> fit so near ,
His nails already are turn ’ d <unk> , and he
<unk> all o ’ er , if he but eye the shade ;
Such was my cheer at hearing of his words .
But shame soon interpos ’ d her threat , who makes
The servant bold in presence of his lord .
I settled me upon those shoulders huge ,
And would have said , but that the words to aid
My purpose came not , “ Look thou clasp me firm ! ”
But he whose succour then not first I prov ’ d ,
Soon as I mounted , in his arms aloft ,
Embracing , held me up , and thus he spake :
“ Geryon ! now move thee ! be thy wheeling <unk>
Of ample circuit , easy thy descent .
Think on th ’ <unk> burden thou sustain ’ st . ”
As a small vessel , back ’ ning out from land ,
Her station quits ; so thence the monster loos ’ d ,
And when he felt himself at large , turn ’ d round
There where the breast had been , his forked tail .
Thus , like an <unk> , outstretch ’ d at length he <unk> ’ d ,
Gath ’ ring the air up with <unk> claws .
Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
The reins let drop at random , whence high heaven ,
Whereof <unk> yet appear , was wrapt in flames ;
Nor when <unk> <unk> perceiv ’ d ,
By <unk> of the <unk> wax ,
The trusted pennons loosen ’ d from his loins ,
His sire exclaiming loud , “ Ill way thou keep ’ st ! ”
Than was my dread , when round me on each part
The air I view ’ d , and other object none
Save the fell beast . He slowly sailing , wheels
His downward motion , unobserv ’ d of me ,
But that the wind , <unk> to my face ,
<unk> on me from below . Now on our right
I heard the <unk> beneath us leap
With hideous crash ; whence bending down to ’ explore ,
New terror I conceiv ’ d at the steep plunge :
For flames I saw , and wailings smote mine ear :
So that all trembling close I <unk> ’ d my limbs ,
And then distinguish ’ d , <unk> ’ d before ,
By the dread torments that on every side
Drew nearer , how our downward course we wound .
As falcon , that hath long been on the wing ,
But lure nor bird hath seen , while in <unk>
The <unk> cries , “ Ah me ! thou stoop ’ st to earth ! ”
<unk> descends , and swiftly down the sky
In many an orbit wheels , then lighting sits
At distance from his lord in angry mood ;
So Geryon lighting places us on foot
Low down at base of the <unk> ’ d rock ,
And , of his burden there discharg ’ d , forthwith
<unk> forward , like an arrow from the <unk> .
CANTO XVIII
There is a place within the depths of hell
Call ’ d Malebolge , all of rock <unk> ’ d
With hue <unk> , e ’ en as the steep
That round it circling winds . Right in the midst
Of that <unk> region , <unk>
A <unk> gulf profound , whereof the frame
Due time shall tell . The circle , that remains ,
Throughout its round , between the gulf and base
Of the high craggy banks , successive forms
<unk> <unk> , in its hollow bottom sunk .
As where to guard the walls , full many a foss
<unk> some stately castle , sure <unk>
<unk> to the space within , so here
Were model ’ d these ; and as like <unk>
E ’ en from their threshold to the brink without ,
Are flank ’ d with <unk> ; from the rock ’ s low base
Thus flinty <unk> advanc ’ d , that ’ cross the <unk>
And <unk> , struck onward far as to the gulf ,
That in one bound <unk> cuts them off .
Such was the place , wherein we found ourselves
From Geryon ’ s back dislodg ’ d . The bard to left
Held on his way , and I behind him mov ’ d .
On our right hand new misery I saw ,
New pains , new <unk> of wrath ,
That swarming <unk> the first chasm . Below
Were naked sinners . <unk> they came ,
Meeting our faces from the middle point ,
With us beyond but with a larger <unk> .
E ’ en thus the Romans , when the year returns
Of <unk> , with better speed to rid
The <unk> multitudes , their means devise
For such as pass the bridge ; that on one side
All front toward the castle , and approach
Saint Peter ’ s fane , on th ’ other towards the mount .
Each divers way along the <unk> rock ,
<unk> ’ d demons I beheld , with <unk> huge ,
That on their back <unk> smote .
Ah ! how they made them bound at the first <unk> !
None for the second waited nor the third .
Meantime as on I pass ’ d , one met my sight
Whom soon as view ’ d ; “ Of him , ” cried I , “ not yet
Mine eye hath had his fill . ” With fixed gaze
I therefore scann ’ d him . Straight the teacher kind
<unk> ’ d with me , and <unk> I should walk
Backward a space , and the tormented spirit ,
Who thought to hide him , bent his visage down .
But it avail ’ d him nought ; for I exclaim ’ d :
“ Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground ,
Unless thy features do <unk> thee much ,
<unk> art thou . But what brings thee
Into this bitter <unk> ’ ning ? ” He replied :
“ <unk> I answer to thy words .
But thy clear speech , that to my mind <unk>
The world I once <unk> , <unk> me .
Know then ’ twas I who led fair <unk>
To do the Marquis ’ will , <unk> fame
The shameful tale have <unk> . Nor alone
Bologna hither <unk> me to mourn
Rather with us the place is so o ’ erthrong ’ d
That not so many tongues this day are taught ,
Betwixt the Reno and <unk> ’ s stream ,
To answer <unk> in their country ’ s phrase .
And if of that <unk> proof thou need ,
Remember but our craving thirst for gold . ”
Him speaking thus , a demon with his <unk>
Struck , and exclaim ’ d , “ Away ! <unk> ! here
<unk> are none for sale . ” Forthwith I join ’ d
My escort , and few paces thence we came
To where a rock forth issued from the bank .
That easily ascended , to the right
Upon its splinter turning , we depart
From those eternal <unk> . When arriv ’ d ,
Where underneath the <unk> arch lets pass
The <unk> souls : “ Pause here , ” the teacher said ,
“ And let these others miserable , now
Strike on thy ken , faces not yet beheld ,
For that together they with us have walk ’ d . ”
From the old bridge we ey ’ d the <unk> , who came
From th ’ other side towards us , like the rest ,
<unk> from the <unk> . My gentle guide ,
By me <unk> ’ d , thus his speech resum ’ d :
“ Behold that lofty shade , who this way tends ,
And seems too <unk> to drop a tear .
How yet the <unk> aspect he <unk> !
Jason is he , whose skill and prowess won
The <unk> from Colchos . To the <unk> isle
His passage thither led him , when those bold
And pitiless women had slain all their males .
There he with tokens and fair <unk> words
<unk> beguil ’ d , a virgin young ,
Who first had all the rest herself beguil ’ d .
<unk> he left her there forlorn .
Such is the guilt <unk> him to this pain .
Here too <unk> ’ s <unk> ’ ries are <unk> .
All bear him company , who like deceit
To his have practis ’ d . And thus much to know
Of the first vale suffice thee , and of those
Whom its keen torments urge . ” Now had we come
Where , <unk> the next pier , the straighten ’ d path
<unk> its shoulders to another arch .
Hence in the second chasm we heard the <unk> ,
Who <unk> in low <unk> sounds ,
With <unk> ’ d nostrils <unk> , and on themselves
<unk> with their palms . Upon the banks a <unk>
From the foul steam <unk> ’ d , <unk> hung ,
That held sharp <unk> with the sight and smell .
So hollow is the depth , that from no part ,
Save on the summit of the rocky <unk> ,
Could I distinguish aught . Thus far we came ;
And thence I saw , within the foss below ,
A crowd immers ’ d in <unk> , that appear ’ d
<unk> of the human body . There beneath
<unk> with eye <unk> , I mark ’ d
One with his head so <unk> ’ d , ’ twere hard to deem ,
If he were <unk> or <unk> . Loud he cried :
“ Why <unk> thus <unk> more on me ,
Than on these other filthy ones , thy ken ? ”
“ Because if true my <unk> ’ ry , ” I replied ,
“ I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks ,
And thou <unk> art of Lucca sprung .
Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more . ”
Then beating on his brain these words he spake :
“ Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk ,
Wherewith I ne ’ er enough could <unk> my tongue . ”
My leader thus : “ A little further stretch
Thy face , that thou the visage well mayst note
Of that <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
Who there doth rend her with <unk> nails ,
Now crouching down , now risen on her feet .
“ <unk> is this , the harlot , whose false lip
Answer ’ d her doting <unk> that ask ’ d ,
‘ <unk> me much ! ’ — ‘ Say rather wondrously , ’
And seeing this here <unk> be our view . ”
CANTO XIX
Woe to thee , <unk> <unk> ! woe to you ,
His wretched followers ! who the things of God ,
Which should be wedded unto goodness , them ,
<unk> as ye are , do <unk>
For gold and silver in <unk> !
Now must the <unk> sound for you , since yours
Is the third chasm . Upon the following vault
We now had mounted , where the rock <unk>
<unk> o ’ er the centre of the foss .
Wisdom Supreme ! how <unk> the art ,
Which thou dost manifest in heaven , in earth ,
And in the evil world , how just a <unk>
<unk> by thy virtue unto all !
I saw the livid stone , throughout the sides
And in its bottom full of <unk> ,
All equal in their <unk> , and circular each ,
Nor ample less nor larger they appear ’ d
Than in Saint John ’ s fair dome of me belov ’ d
Those fram ’ d to hold the pure <unk> streams ,
One of the which I brake , some few years past ,
To save a <unk> infant ; and be this
A seal to <unk> whoever doubts
The motive of my deed . From out the mouth
Of every one , <unk> ’ d a sinner ’ s feet
And of the legs high upward as the <unk>
The rest beneath was hid . On either foot
The soles were burning , whence the <unk> joints
<unk> ’ d with such violent motion , as had <unk>
<unk> cords or twisted <unk> . As flame ,
<unk> on unctuous matter , glides along
The surface , scarcely touching where it moves ;
So here , from <unk> to point , <unk> the flames .
“ Master ! say who is he , than all the rest
Glancing in fiercer agony , on whom
A ruddier flame doth prey ? ” I thus inquir ’ d .
“ If thou be willing , ” he replied , “ that I
<unk> thee down , where least the slope bank falls ,
He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs . ”
I then : “ As pleases thee to me is best .
Thou art my lord ; and know ’ st that ne ’ er I quit
Thy will : what silence hides that knowest thou . ”
Thereat on the fourth pier we came , we turn ’ d ,
And on our left descended to the depth ,
A narrow strait and <unk> close .
Nor from his side my leader set me down ,
Till to his <unk> he brought , whose limb
<unk> ’ ring express ’ d his pang . “ Whoe ’ er thou art ,
Sad spirit ! thus revers ’ d , and as a stake
Driv ’ n in the soil ! ” I in these words began ,
“ If thou be able , utter forth thy voice . ”
There stood I like the friar , that doth <unk>
A wretch for murder doom ’ d , who e ’ en when fix ’ d ,
<unk> him back , whence death awhile delays .
He shouted : “ <unk> ! already standest there ?
Already standest there , O Boniface !
By many a year the <unk> play ’ d me false .
So early dost thou <unk> with the wealth ,
For which thou <unk> not in guile to take
The lovely lady , and then <unk> her ? ”
I felt as those who , piercing not the <unk>
Of answer made them , stand as if expos ’ d
In mockery , nor know what to reply ,
When Virgil thus <unk> ’ d : “ Tell him quick ,
I am not he , not he , whom thou believ ’ st . ”
And I , as was enjoin ’ d me , straight replied .
That heard , the spirit all did wrench his feet ,
And sighing next in woeful accent spake :
“ What then of me requirest ? ” “ If to know
So much imports thee , who I am , that thou
Hast therefore down the bank descended , learn
That in the mighty mantle I was rob ’ d ,
And of a <unk> was indeed the son ,
So eager to advance my whelps , that there
My having in my purse above I stow ’ d ,
And here myself . Under my head are dragg ’ d
The rest , my <unk> in the guilt
Of simony . Stretch ’ d at their length they lie
Along an opening in the rock . ’ Midst them
I also low shall fall , soon as he comes ,
For whom I took thee , when so <unk>
I question ’ d . But already longer time
Hath pass ’ d , since my souls kindled , and I thus
<unk> ’ d have stood , than is his doom to stand
Planted with fiery feet . For after him ,
One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive ,
From forth the west , a shepherd without law ,
<unk> to cover both his form and mine .
He a new Jason shall be call ’ d , of whom
In <unk> we read ; and favour such
As to that priest his king <unk> show ’ d ,
Shall be of France ’ s monarch shown to him . ”
I know not if I here too far <unk> ’ d ,
But in this strain I answer ’ d : “ Tell me now ,
What <unk> from <unk> Peter at the first
Our Lord <unk> , when he put the keys
Into his charge ? <unk> he ask ’ d no more
But , Follow me ! Nor Peter nor the rest
Or gold or silver of <unk> took ,
When lots were cast upon the <unk> place
Of the condemned soul . <unk> thou then ;
Thy punishment of right is merited :
And look thou well to that <unk> coin ,
Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir ’ d .
If reverence of the keys restrain ’ d me not ,
Which thou in happier time didst hold , I yet
Severer speech might use . Your avarice
O ’ <unk> the world with mourning , under foot
<unk> the good , and raising bad men up .
Of shepherds , like to you , th ’ Evangelist
Was ware , when her , who sits upon the waves ,
With kings in filthy <unk> he beheld ,
She who with seven heads tower ’ d at her birth ,
And from ten horns her proof of glory drew ,
Long as her spouse in virtue took delight .
Of gold and silver ye have made your god ,
<unk> ’ ring wherein from the <unk> ,
But he that <unk> one , a hundred ye ?
Ah , Constantine ! to how much ill gave birth ,
Not thy conversion , but that <unk> dower ,
Which the first wealthy Father gain ’ d from thee ! ”
Meanwhile , as thus I sung , he , whether wrath
Or conscience smote him , violent <unk>
<unk> on either sole . I do believe
My teacher well was pleas ’ d , with so <unk> ’ d
A lip , he listen ’ d ever to the sound
Of the true words I utter ’ d . In both arms
He caught , and to his bosom lifting me
Upward <unk> ’ d the way of his descent .
Nor weary of his weight he press ’ d me close ,
Till to the summit of the rock we came ,
Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier .
His cherish ’ d burden there gently he plac ’ d
Upon the rugged rock and steep , a path
Not easy for the clamb ’ ring goat to mount .
Thence to my view another vale appear ’ d
CANTO XX
And now the verse proceeds to torments new ,
<unk> argument of this the <unk> strain
Of the first song , whose <unk> theme records
The spirits whelm ’ d in woe . <unk> I look ’ d
Into the depth , that open ’ d to my view ,
<unk> ’ d with tears of anguish , and beheld
A tribe , that came along the hollow vale ,
In silence weeping : such their step as walk
<unk> chanting solemn <unk> on earth .
As on them more direct mine eye descends ,
Each wondrously seem ’ d to be revers ’ d
At the <unk> , so that the countenance
Was from the reins <unk> : and because
None might before him look , they were compell ’ d
To ’ advance with backward gait . Thus one perhaps
Hath been by force of <unk> clean <unk> ’ d ,
But I ne ’ er saw it nor believe it so .
Now , reader ! think within thyself , so God
Fruit of thy reading give thee ! how I long
Could keep my visage dry , when I beheld
Near me our form distorted in such guise ,
That on the hinder parts fall ’ n from the face
The tears <unk> roll ’ d . Against a rock
I <unk> and wept , so that my guide exclaim ’ d :
“ What , and art thou too witless as the rest ?
Here pity most doth show herself alive ,
When she is dead . What guilt <unk> his ,
Who with Heaven ’ s judgment in his passion strives ?
Raise up thy head , raise up , and see the man ,
Before whose eyes earth gap ’ d in Thebes , when all
Cried out , ‘ <unk> , whither <unk> ?
‘ Why <unk> thou the war ? ’ He not the less
Fell <unk> far as to Minos down ,
Whose grapple none eludes . Lo ! how he makes
The breast his shoulders , and who once too far
Before him wish ’ d to see , now backward looks ,
And treads reverse his path . Tiresias note ,
Who semblance chang ’ d , when woman he became
Of <unk> , through every limb transform ’ d , and then
Once more behov ’ d him with his <unk> to strike
The two <unk> serpents , ere the plumes ,
That mark ’ d the better <unk> , might shoot again .
“ <unk> , with more his belly <unk> , comes .
On <unk> ’ s mountains ’ midst the <unk> white ,
Where <unk> <unk> ’ s hind , who <unk> beneath ,
A cavern was his dwelling , whence the stars
And <unk> wide in <unk> view he held .
“ The next , whose loosen ’ d tresses overspread
Her bosom , which thou seest not ( for each hair
On that side grows ) was <unk> , she who search ’ d
Through many regions , and at length her seat
Fix ’ d in my native land , whence a short space
My words detain thy <unk> . When her sire
From life departed , and in <unk>
The city <unk> to Bacchus mourn ’ d ,
Long time she went a wand ’ <unk> through the world .
Aloft in Italy ’ s delightful land
A lake there lies , at foot of that proud Alp ,
That o ’ er the <unk> locks <unk> in ,
Its name Benacus , which a thousand rills ,
Methinks , and more , water between the vale
<unk> and <unk> and the height
Of Apennine remote . There is a spot
At midway of that lake , where he who bears
Of Trento ’ s flock the past ’ ral staff , with him
Of <unk> , and the <unk> , might each
Passing that way his <unk> give .
A <unk> of goodly site and strong
<unk> stands , to awe with front oppos ’ d
The <unk> and <unk> , whence the shore
More slope each way descends . There , <unk> ’ er
Benacus ’ bosom holds not , <unk> o ’ er
Down falls , and winds a river flood beneath
Through the green <unk> . Soon as in his course
The steam makes head , Benacus then no more
They call the name , but <unk> , till at last
<unk> <unk> into Po he falls .
Not far his course hath run , when a wide <unk>
It finds , which <unk> as a marsh
It covers , pestilent in summer oft .
Hence journeying , the savage maiden saw
’ Midst of the fen a territory waste
And naked of inhabitants . To shun
All human converse , here she with her slaves
<unk> her arts remain ’ d , and liv ’ d , and left
Her body tenantless . Thenceforth the tribes ,
Who round were scatter ’ d , gath ’ ring to that place
<unk> ; for its strength was great , enclos ’ d
On all parts by the fen . On those dead bones
They rear ’ d themselves a city , for her sake ,
<unk> it Mantua , who first chose the spot ,
Nor ask ’ d another <unk> for the name ,
Wherein more numerous the people dwelt ,
Ere <unk> ’ s madness by deceit
Was wrong ’ d of <unk> . If thou hear
Henceforth another origin assign ’ d
Of that my country , I forewarn thee now ,
That falsehood none <unk> thee of the truth . ”
I answer ’ d : “ Teacher , I conclude thy words
So certain , that all else shall be to me
As <unk> <unk> life . But now of these ,
Who here proceed , instruct me , if thou see
Any that merit more <unk> note .
For <unk> is my mind alone intent . ”
He straight replied : “ That spirit , from whose cheek
The beard sweeps o ’ er his shoulders brown , what time
<unk> was <unk> of her males , that scarce
The <unk> were supplied , the <unk> was he
In <unk> , who with <unk> gave the sign
When first to cut the <unk> . Him they nam ’ d
<unk> : so <unk> my <unk> strain ,
In which <unk> measure well thou know ’ st ,
Who know ’ st it all . That other , round the loins
So slender of his shape , was Michael <unk> ,
<unk> ’ d in ev ’ ry slight of <unk> <unk> .
“ Guido <unk> see : <unk> mark ,
Who now were willing , he had tended still
The thread and <unk> ; and too late <unk> .
“ See next the wretches , who the needle left ,
The shuttle and the <unk> , and became
<unk> : <unk> <unk> they wrought
With images and herbs . But onward now :
For now doth Cain with fork of thorns <unk>
On either hemisphere , touching the wave
Beneath the towers of Seville . <unk>
The moon was round . Thou mayst remember well :
For she good service did thee in the gloom
Of the deep wood . ” This said , both onward mov ’ d .
CANTO XXI
Thus we from bridge to bridge , with other talk ,
The which my <unk> cares not to <unk> ,
Pass ’ d on ; and to the summit reaching , stood
To view another gap , within the round
Of Malebolge , other <unk> pangs .
<unk> darkness shadow ’ d o ’ er the place .
In the <unk> ’ <unk> as boils
Through wintry months <unk> pitch , to smear
Their unsound vessels ; for th ’ <unk> time
<unk> men restrains , and in that while
His bark one <unk> anew , another stops
The ribs of his , that hath made many a voyage ;
One <unk> at the prow , one at the poop ;
This shapeth oars , that other <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> one repairs and <unk> rent
So not by force of fire but art divine
<unk> ’ d here a <unk> thick mass , that round
<unk> ’ d all the shore beneath . I that beheld ,
But therein nought distinguish ’ d , save the <unk> ,
Rais ’ d by the boiling , in one mighty swell
<unk> , and by turns <unk> and fall . While there
I fix ’ d my ken below , “ Mark ! mark ! ” my guide
Exclaiming , drew me towards him from the place ,
Wherein I stood . I turn ’ d myself as one ,
Impatient to behold that which beheld
He needs must shun , whom sudden fear <unk> ,
That he his flight delays not for the view .
Behind me I discern ’ d a devil black ,
That running , up advanc ’ d along the rock .
Ah ! what fierce cruelty his look bespake !
In act how bitter did he seem , with wings
<unk> outstretch ’ d and feet of nimblest tread !
His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
Was with a sinner <unk> ’ d ; by either haunch
He held him , the foot ’ s <unk> <unk> fast .
“ Ye of our bridge ! ” he cried , “ <unk> ’ d fiends !
Lo ! one of <unk> <unk> ’ s elders ! Him
Whelm ye beneath , while I return for more .
That land hath store of such . All men are there ,
Except <unk> , <unk> : of ‘ no ’
For <unk> there an ‘ aye ’ is quickly made . ”
Him dashing down , o ’ er the rough rock he turn ’ d ,
Nor ever after <unk> a mastiff loos ’ d
Sped with like eager haste . That other sank
And forthwith writhing to the surface rose .
But those dark demons , shrouded by the bridge ,
Cried “ Here the hallow ’ d visage saves not : here
Is other swimming than in <unk> ’ s wave .
Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not ,
Take heed thou mount not o ’ er the pitch . ” This said ,
They grappled him with more than hundred hooks ,
And shouted : “ Cover ’ d thou must sport thee here ;
So , if thou canst , in secret mayst thou <unk> . ”
E ’ en thus the <unk> <unk> him , with his <unk> ,
To thrust the flesh into the <unk> down
With <unk> , that it float not on the top .
Me then my guide bespake : “ Lest they descry ,
That thou art here , behind a craggy rock
Bend low and screen thee ; and whate ’ er of force
Be offer ’ d me , or insult , fear thou not :
For I am well <unk> ’ d , who have been erst
In the like fray . ” Beyond the bridge ’ s head
Therewith he pass ’ d , and reaching the sixth pier ,
<unk> ’ d him then a forehead <unk> .
With storm and fury , as when dogs rush forth
Upon the poor man ’ s back , who suddenly
From whence he standeth makes his suit ; so rush ’ d
Those from beneath the arch , and against him
Their weapons all they pointed . He aloud :
“ Be none of you <unk> : ere your time
<unk> <unk> me , come forth from amongst you one ,
“ Who having heard my words , <unk> he then
If he shall tear these limbs . ” They shouted loud ,
“ Go , Malacoda ! ” Whereat one advanc ’ d ,
The others standing firm , and as he came ,
“ What may this turn avail him ? ” he exclaim ’ d .
“ Believ ’ st thou , Malacoda ! I had come
Thus far from all your <unk> secure , ”
My teacher answered , “ without will divine
And destiny <unk> ? Pass we then
For so Heaven ’ s pleasure is , that I should lead
Another through this savage wilderness . ”
Forthwith so fell his pride , that he let drop
The <unk> of <unk> at his feet ,
And to the rest exclaim ’ d : “ We have no power
To strike him . ” Then to me my guide : “ O thou !
Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
Low crouching , <unk> now to me return . ”
I rose , and towards him moved with speed : the fiends
Meantime all forward drew : me terror seiz ’ d
Lest they should break the compact they had made .
Thus issuing from <unk> , once I saw
Th ’ <unk> <unk> , lest his covenant
The foe should break ; so close he <unk> ’ d them round .
I to my leader ’ s side <unk> ’ d , mine eyes
With <unk> and motionless <unk> bent
On their <unk> visage . They their hooks
<unk> , one the other thus bespake :
“ <unk> thou I touch him on the <unk> ? ” To whom
Was answer ’ d : “ Even so ; nor miss thy aim . ”
But he , who was in conf ’ rence with my guide ,
Turn ’ d rapid round , and thus the demon spake :
“ <unk> , stay thee , <unk> ! ” Then to us
He added : “ <unk> footing to your step
This rock <unk> not , shiver ’ d to the base
Of the sixth arch . But would you still proceed ,
Up by this cavern go : not distant far ,
Another rock will yield you passage safe .
<unk> , <unk> by five hours than now ,
<unk> hundred <unk> years and six had fill ’ d
The circuit of their course , since here the way
Was broken . Thitherward I straight dispatch
<unk> of these my <unk> , who shall <unk>
If any on the surface <unk> . With them
Go ye : for ye shall find them nothing fell .
Come Alichino forth , ” with that he cried ,
“ And Calcabrina , and Cagnazzo thou !
The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead .
With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste ,
<unk> ’ d Ciriatto , <unk> fierce ,
And Farfarello , and mad Rubicant .
Search ye around the <unk> tar . For these ,
In safety lead them , where the other crag
<unk> <unk> the <unk> . ”
I then : “ O master ! what a sight is there !
Ah ! without escort , journey we alone ,
Which , if thou know the way , I covet not .
Unless thy <unk> fail thee , dost not mark
How they do <unk> upon us , and their scowl
<unk> us present tortures ? ” He replied :
“ I charge thee fear not : let them , as they will ,
<unk> on : ’ t is but in token of their spite
Against the souls , who mourn in torment steep ’ d . ”
To leftward o ’ er the pier they turn ’ d ; but each
Had first between his teeth <unk> close the tongue ,
Toward their leader for a signal looking ,
Which he with sound <unk> <unk> gave .
CANTO XXII
It hath been heretofore my chance to see
<unk> with <unk> order shifting <unk> ,
To <unk> <unk> , or in <unk> rang ’ d ,
Or in retreat sometimes outstretch ’ d for flight ;
<unk> <unk> and fleet <unk>
<unk> thy plains , Arezzo ! have I seen ,
And <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,
Now with the sound of trumpets , now of <unk> ,
<unk> , or <unk> made from <unk> heights ,
And with <unk> <unk> , our own ,
Or introduc ’ d from <unk> land ; but ne ’ er
To such a strange <unk> I beheld ,
In <unk> moving , horse nor foot ,
Nor ship , that <unk> ’ d by sign from land or star .
With the ten demons on our way we went ;
Ah fearful company ! but in the church
With <unk> , with <unk> at the <unk> ’ s <unk> .
Still earnest on the pitch I gaz ’ d , to mark
All things whate ’ er the chasm contain ’ d , and those
Who burn ’ d within . As <unk> , that , in sign
To mariners , heave high their <unk> backs ,
That thence forewarn ’ d they may <unk> to save
Their threaten ’ d vessels ; so , at <unk> ,
To ease the pain his back some sinner show ’ d ,
Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance .
E ’ en as the frogs , that of a wat ’ ry moat
Stand at the brink , with the jaws only out ,
Their feet and of the trunk all else <unk> ,
Thus on each part the sinners stood , but soon
As Barbariccia was at hand , so they
Drew back under the wave . I saw , and yet
My heart doth <unk> , one , that waited thus ,
As it <unk> that oft one frog remains ,
While the next springs away : and <unk> ,
Who of the fiends was nearest , <unk> seiz ’ d
His <unk> locks , and dragg ’ d him <unk> up ,
That he appear ’ d to me an <unk> . Each
Already by their names I knew , so well
When they were chosen , I observ ’ d , and mark ’ d
How one the other call ’ d . “ O Rubicant !
See that his hide thou with thy talons <unk> , ”
<unk> together all the cursed crew .
Then I : “ <unk> thee , master ! if thou may ,
What wretched soul is this , on whom their hand
His foes have laid . ” My leader to his side
Approach ’ d , and whence he came inquir ’ d , to whom
Was answer ’ d thus : “ Born in Navarre ’ s <unk>
My mother plac ’ d me in a lord ’ s <unk> ,
For she had borne me to a <unk> vile ,
A <unk> of his substance and himself .
The good king <unk> after that I serv ’ d ,
To <unk> here my thoughts were turn ’ d ,
Whereof I give account in this dire heat . ”
Straight Ciriatto , from whose mouth a <unk>
<unk> on either side , as from a boar ,
<unk> him with one of these . ’ Twixt evil claws
The mouse had fall ’ n : but Barbariccia cried ,
<unk> him with both arms : “ Stand thou apart ,
While I do fix him on my prong transpierc ’ d . ”
Then added , turning to my guide his face ,
“ <unk> of him , if more thou wish to learn ,
Ere he again be rent . ” My leader thus :
“ Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt ;
<unk> thou any sprung of Latian land
Under the tar ? ” — “ I parted , ” he replied ,
“ But now from one , who sojourn ’ d not far thence ;
So were I under shelter now with him !
Nor hook nor <unk> then should scare me more . ” — .
“ Too long we suffer , ” Libicocco cried ,
Then , darting forth a prong , seiz ’ d on his arm ,
And mangled bore away the <unk> part .
Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
Would next have caught , whence angrily their chief ,
Turning on all sides round , with threat ’ ning brow
Restrain ’ d them . When their strife a little ceas ’ d ,
Of him , who yet was gazing on his wound ,
My teacher thus without delay inquir ’ d :
“ Who was the spirit , from whom by evil hap
<unk> , as thou has told , thou <unk> ’ st to shore ? ” —
“ It was the friar <unk> , ” he rejoin ’ d ,
“ He of Gallura , vessel of all guile ,
Who had his master ’ s enemies in hand ,
And us ’ d them so that they commend him well .
<unk> he took , and them at large dismiss ’ d .
So he reports : and in each other charge
<unk> to his keeping , play ’ d the part
Of barterer to the height : with him doth herd
The chief of <unk> , <unk> Zanche .
Sardinia is a theme , whereof their tongue
Is never weary . <unk> ! alas ! behold
That other , how he <unk> ! More would I say ,
But tremble lest he mean to <unk> me sore . ”
Their <unk> then to Farfarello turning ,
Who roll ’ d his <unk> eyes in act to strike ,
<unk> ’ d him thus : “ Off ! cursed bird ! <unk> ! ” —
“ If ye desire to see or hear , ” he thus
<unk> with dread resum ’ d , “ or Tuscan spirits
Or Lombard , I will cause them to appear .
Meantime let these ill talons <unk> their fury ,
So that no vengeance they may fear from them ,
And I , remaining in this self-same place ,
Will for myself but one , make sev ’ n appear ,
When my shrill <unk> shall be heard ; for so
Our custom is to call each other up . ”
Cagnazzo at that word <unk> <unk> ’ d ,
Then <unk> ’ d the head and spake : “ Hear his device ,
<unk> as he is , to plunge him down . ”
<unk> he thus , who fail ’ d not in rich store
Of <unk> toils ; “ <unk> <unk> extreme ,
<unk> only to <unk> myself more woe ! ”
No longer Alichino then refrain ’ d ,
But thus , the rest <unk> , him bespake :
“ If thou do cast thee down , I not on foot
Will chase thee , but above the pitch will beat
My plumes . <unk> we the vantage ground , and let
The bank be as a shield , that we may see
If singly thou prevail against us all . ”
Now , reader , of new sport expect to hear !
They each one turn ’ d his eyes to the other shore ,
He first , who was the <unk> to persuade .
The spirit of Navarre chose well his time ,
Planted his feet on land , and at one leap
<unk> <unk> their resolve .
Them quick resentment stung , but him the most ,
Who was the cause of failure ; in pursuit
He therefore sped , exclaiming : “ Thou art caught . ”
But little it avail ’ d : terror <unk> ’ d
His following flight : the other plung ’ d beneath ,
And he with upward <unk> rais ’ d his breast :
E ’ en thus the <unk> , when she perceives
The falcon near , <unk> instant down , while he
<unk> ’ d and spent retires . That mockery
In Calcabrina fury stirr ’ d , who flew
After him , with desire of strife inflam ’ d ;
And , for the barterer had ’ scap ’ d , so turn ’ d
His talons on his <unk> . O ’ er the <unk>
In grapple close they join ’ d ; but the other prov ’ d
A <unk> able to rend well his foe ;
And in the boiling lake both fell . The heat
Was <unk> soon between them , but in vain
To lift themselves they strove , so fast were <unk>
Their pennons . Barbariccia , as the rest ,
That chance lamenting , four in flight dispatch ’ d
From the other coast , with all their weapons arm ’ d .
They , to their post on each side speedily
Descending , stretch ’ d their hooks toward the fiends ,
Who <unk> ’ d , inly burning from their scars :
And we departing left them to that <unk> .
CANTO XXIII
In silence and in <unk> we went ,
One first , the other following his steps ,
As <unk> friars journeying on their road .
The present fray had turn ’ d my thoughts to muse
Upon old <unk> ’ s <unk> , where he told
What fate unto the mouse and frog befell .
For language hath not sounds more like in sense ,
Than are these chances , if the origin
And end of each be <unk> compar ’ d .
And as one thought <unk> from another forth ,
So afterward from that another sprang ,
Which added doubly to my former fear .
For thus I reason ’ d : “ These through us have been
So foil ’ d , with loss and mock ’ ry so complete ,
As needs must sting them sore . If anger then
Be to their evil will conjoin ’ d , more fell
They shall pursue us , than the savage <unk>
<unk> the <unk> , panting ’ twixt his jaws . ”
Already I perceiv ’ d my hair stand all
On end with terror , and look ’ d eager back .
“ Teacher , ” I thus began , “ if speedily
<unk> and me thou hide not , much I dread
Those evil talons . Even now behind
They urge us : quick imagination works
So forcibly , that I already feel them . ”
He answer ’ d : “ Were I form ’ d of <unk> glass ,
I should not sooner draw unto myself
Thy outward image , than I now imprint
That from within . This moment came thy thoughts
Presented before mine , with similar act
And count ’ nance similar , so that from both
I one design have fram ’ d . If the right coast
Incline so much , that we may thence descend
Into the other chasm , we shall escape
<unk> from this <unk> pursuit . ”
He had not spoke his purpose to the end ,
When I from far beheld them with spread wings
Approach to take us . <unk> my guide
Caught me , ev ’ n as a mother that from sleep
Is by the noise <unk> ’ d , and near her sees
The climbing fires , who <unk> up her babe
And flies ne ’ er pausing , careful more of him
Than of herself , that but a single <unk>
<unk> round her limbs . Down from the <unk> <unk>
Supine he cast him , to that pendent rock ,
Which closes on one part the other chasm .
Never ran water with such <unk> pace
Adown the <unk> to turn a <unk> ’ s wheel ,
When nearest it <unk> to the <unk> ,
As then along that edge my master ran ,
Carrying me in his bosom , as a child ,
Not a companion . Scarcely had his feet
Reach ’ d to the lowest of the bed beneath ,
When over us the steep they reach ’ d ; but fear
In him was none ; for that high Providence ,
Which plac ’ d them ministers of the fifth foss ,
Power of departing thence took from them all .
There in the depth we saw a painted tribe ,
Who pac ’ d with tardy steps around , and wept ,
<unk> in appearance and o ’ ercome with toil .
<unk> had they on , with <unk> , that fell low down
Before their eyes , in fashion like to those
<unk> by the <unk> in <unk> . Their outside
Was <unk> with gold , dazzling to view ,
But leaden all within , and of such weight ,
That Frederick ’ s compar ’ d to these were <unk> .
Oh , everlasting wearisome <unk> !
We yet once more with them together turn ’ d
To leftward , on their dismal <unk> intent .
But by the weight oppress ’ d , so slowly came
The fainting people , that our company
Was chang ’ d at every <unk> of the step .
Whence I my guide address ’ d : “ See that thou find
Some spirit , whose name may by his deeds be known ,
And to that end look round thee as thou go ’ st . ”
Then one , who understood the Tuscan voice ,
Cried after us aloud : “ <unk> in your feet ,
Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air .
Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish . ”
Whereat my leader , turning , me bespake :
“ Pause , and then onward at their pace proceed . ”
I <unk> , and saw two Spirits in whose look
Impatient eagerness of mind was mark ’ d
To <unk> me ; but the load they bare
And narrow path retarded their approach .
Soon as arriv ’ d , they with an eye askance
<unk> ’ d me , but spake not : then turning each
To other thus <unk> said : “ This one
Seems , by the action of his throat , alive .
And , be they dead , what privilege allows
They walk <unk> by the <unk> stole ? ”
Then thus to me : “ Tuscan , who <unk>
The college of the mourning <unk> ,
<unk> not to instruct us who thou art . ”
“ By Arno ’ s pleasant stream , ” I thus replied ,
“ In the great city I was bred and grew ,
And wear the body I have ever worn .
but who are ye , from whom such mighty grief ,
As now I witness , courseth down your cheeks ?
What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe ? ”
“ Our <unk> <unk> bright with orange hue , ”
One of them answer ’ d , “ are so leaden gross ,
That with their weight they make the <unk>
To <unk> beneath them . <unk> friars we were ,
Bologna ’ s <unk> , Catalano I ,
He <unk> nam ’ d , and by thy land
Together taken , as men <unk> to take
A single and <unk> <unk> ,
To reconcile their <unk> . How there we sped ,
<unk> ’ s <unk> can best declare . ”
“ O friars ! ” I began , “ your <unk> — ”
But there brake off , for one had caught my eye ,
Fix ’ d to a cross with three <unk> on the ground :
He , when he saw me , writh ’ d himself , throughout
Distorted , <unk> with deep sighs his beard .
And Catalano , who thereof was ’ ware ,
Thus spake : “ That pierced spirit , whom intent
Thou view ’ st , was he who gave the Pharisees
Counsel , that it were fitting for one man
To suffer for the people . He doth lie
<unk> ; nor any passes , but him first
<unk> make feeling trial how each weighs .
In straits like this along the foss are plac ’ d
The father of his consort , and the rest
<unk> in that council , seed of ill
And sorrow to the Jews . ” I noted then ,
How Virgil gaz ’ d with wonder upon him ,
Thus <unk> extended on the cross
In banishment eternal . To the friar
He next his words address ’ d : “ We pray ye tell ,
If so be lawful , whether on our right
Lies any opening in the rock , whereby
We both may issue hence , without constraint
On the dark angels , that compell ’ d they come
To lead us from this depth . ” He thus replied :
“ Nearer than thou dost hope , there is a rock
From the next circle moving , which o ’ <unk>
Each vale of horror , save that here his cope
Is shatter ’ d . By the ruin ye may mount :
For on the side it <unk> , and most the height
Rises below . ” With head bent down awhile
My leader stood , then spake : “ He warn ’ d us ill ,
Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook . ”
To whom the friar : “ At Bologna erst
I many <unk> of the devil heard ,
Among the rest was said , ‘ He is a <unk> ,
And the father of lies ! ’ ” When he had spoke ,
My leader with large strides proceeded on ,
Somewhat disturb ’ d with anger in his look .
I therefore left the spirits heavy laden ,
And following , his beloved footsteps mark ’ d .
CANTO XXIV
In the year ’ s early <unk> , when the sun
<unk> his tresses in <unk> ’ <unk> ,
And now towards equal day the <unk> recede ,
When as the <unk> upon the earth <unk> on
Her dazzling sister ’ s image , but not long
Her milder sway endures , then riseth up
The village hind , whom fails his wintry store ,
And looking out beholds the plain around
All <unk> ’ d , whence <unk> he smites
His thighs , and to his <unk> returning in ,
There paces to and fro , wailing his lot ,
As a <unk> and helpless man ;
Then comes he forth again , and feels new hope
Spring in his bosom , <unk> e ’ en thus soon
The world hath chang ’ d its count ’ nance , <unk> his crook ,
And forth to <unk> drives his little flock :
So me my guide <unk> ’ d when I saw
His troubled forehead , and so speedily
That ill was <unk> ’ d ; for at the fallen bridge
Arriving , towards me with a look as sweet ,
He turn ’ d him back , as that I first beheld
At the steep mountain ’ s foot . <unk> well
The ruin , and some counsel first maintain ’ d
With his own thought , he open ’ d wide his arm
And took me up . As one , who , while he works ,
<unk> his labour ’ s issue , that he seems
Still to <unk> the effect , so lifting me
Up to the summit of one <unk> , he fix ’ d
His eye upon another . “ <unk> that , ”
Said he , “ but first make proof , if it be such
As will sustain thee . ” For one <unk> ’ d with lead
This were no journey . Scarcely he , though light ,
And I , though onward push ’ d from crag to crag ,
Could mount . And if the <unk> of this coast
Were not less ample than the last , for him
I know not , but my strength had surely fail ’ d .
But Malebolge all toward the mouth
<unk> of the nethermost abyss ,
The site of every valley hence <unk> ,
That one side upward slope , the other fall .
At length the point of our descent we reach ’ d
From the last flag : soon as to that arriv ’ d ,
So was the breath <unk> from my lungs ,
I could no further , but did seat me there .
“ Now needs thy best of man ; ” so spake my guide :
“ For not on <unk> plumes , nor under shade
Of canopy reposing , fame is won ,
Without which whosoe ’ er <unk> his days
<unk> such vestige of himself on earth ,
As smoke in air or foam upon the wave .
Thou therefore rise : vanish thy <unk>
By the mind ’ s <unk> , in each struggle form ’ d
To vanquish , if she suffer not the weight
Of her corporeal frame to crush her down .
A longer ladder yet remains to scale .
From these to have escap ’ d <unk> not .
If well thou note me , profit by my words . ”
I straightway rose , and show ’ d myself less spent
Than I in truth did feel me . “ On , ” I cried ,
“ For I am stout and fearless . ” Up the rock
Our way we held , more rugged than before ,
<unk> and steeper far to climb . From talk
I ceas ’ d not , as we journey ’ d , so to seem
<unk> faint ; whereat a voice from the other foss
Did issue forth , for utt ’ rance suited ill .
Though on the arch that <unk> there I stood ,
What were the words I knew not , but who spake
Seem ’ d mov ’ d in anger . Down I stoop ’ d to look ,
But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
For <unk> darkness ; wherefore thus I spake :
“ To the next circle , Teacher , bend thy steps ,
And from the wall <unk> we ; for as hence
I hear and understand not , so I see
Beneath , and naught discern . ” — “ I answer not , ”
Said he , “ but by the deed . To fair request
Silent performance <unk> best return . ”
We from the bridge ’ s head descended , where
To the eighth mound it joins , and then the chasm
Opening to view , I saw a crowd within
Of serpents terrible , so strange of shape
And hideous , that remembrance in my veins
Yet <unk> the <unk> current . Of her sands
Let <unk> <unk> no more : if <unk> ,
<unk> and <unk> be her brood ,
<unk> and <unk> , <unk> so dire
Or in such numbers swarming ne ’ er she shew ’ d ,
Not with all <unk> , and whate ’ er
Above the <unk> sea is <unk> ’ d .
Amid this dread <unk> of woe
Ran naked spirits wing ’ d with horrid fear ,
Nor hope had they of <unk> where to hide ,
Or <unk> to charm them out of view .
With serpents were their hands behind them bound ,
Which through their reins <unk> ’ d the tail and head
<unk> in folds before . And lo ! on one
Near to our side , darted an adder up ,
And , where the neck is on the shoulders tied ,
<unk> ’ d him . Far more quickly than e ’ er pen
<unk> O or I , he kindled , burn ’ d , and chang ’ d
To ashes , all pour ’ d out upon the earth .
When there <unk> ’ d he lay , the dust again
<unk> ’ d spontaneous , and the self-same form
<unk> <unk> . So mighty sages tell ,
The <unk> <unk> , when five hundred years
Have well nigh circled , dies , and springs forthwith
<unk> . <unk> nor herb throughout his life
He tastes , but tears of <unk> alone
And <unk> <unk> : <unk> of <unk>
And <unk> his funeral <unk> . As one that falls ,
He knows not how , by force demoniac dragg ’ d
To earth , or through <unk> <unk> up
In chains invisible the powers of man ,
Who , risen from his trance , <unk> around ,
Bewilder ’ d with the <unk> agony
He hath endur ’ d , and wildly staring sighs ;
So stood <unk> the sinner when he rose .
Oh ! how severe God ’ s judgment , that <unk> out
Such blows in stormy vengeance ! Who he was
My teacher next inquir ’ d , and thus in few
He answer ’ d : “ <unk> <unk> am I call ’ d ,
Not long since <unk> down from Tuscany
To this dire <unk> . Me the <unk> life
And not the human pleas ’ d , <unk> that I was ,
Who in Pistoia found my worthy <unk> . ”
I then to Virgil : “ <unk> him stir not hence ,
And ask what crime did thrust him hither : once
A man I knew him <unk> and bloody . ”
The sinner heard and feign ’ d not , but towards me
His mind directing and his face , wherein
Was dismal shame <unk> ’ d , thus he spake :
“ It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
In this sad plight , which thou beholdest , than
When I was taken from the other life .
I have no power permitted to deny
What thou inquirest . ” I am doom ’ d thus low
To dwell , for that the <unk> by me
Was <unk> of its goodly <unk> ,
And with the guilt another falsely <unk> .
But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus ,
So as thou e ’ er shalt ’ scape this darksome realm
Open thine ears and hear what I forebode .
<unk> of the <unk> first Pistoia pines ,
Then Florence changeth citizens and laws .
From Valdimagra , drawn by <unk> Mars ,
A vapour rises , wrapt in turbid mists ,
And sharp and eager <unk> on the storm
With arrowy <unk> o ’ er <unk> ’ s field ,
Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst , and strike
Each helpless <unk> prostrate to the ground .
This have I told , that grief may rend thy heart . ”
CANTO XXV
When he had spoke , the sinner rais ’ d his hands
Pointed in mockery , and cried : “ Take them , God !
I level them at thee ! ” From that day forth
The serpents were my friends ; for round his neck
One of then rolling twisted , as it said ,
“ Be silent , tongue ! ” Another to his arms
<unk> , tied them , <unk> itself
So close , it took from them the power to move .
Pistoia ! Ah Pistoia ! why dost doubt
To turn thee into ashes , cumb ’ ring earth
No longer , since in evil act so far
Thou hast <unk> thy seed ? I did not mark ,
Through all the gloomy circles of the abyss ,
Spirit , that swell ’ d so proudly ’ gainst his God ,
Not him , who headlong fell from Thebes . He fled ,
Nor utter ’ d more ; and after him there came
A centaur full of fury , shouting , “ Where
Where is the <unk> ? ” On Maremma ’ s marsh
<unk> not the serpent tribe , as on his haunch
They <unk> ’ d , to where the human face begins .
Behind his head upon the shoulders lay ,
With open wings , a dragon breathing fire
On <unk> ’ er he met . To me my guide :
“ <unk> is this , who underneath the rock
Of <unk> spread oft a lake of blood .
He , from his brethren parted , here must tread
A different journey , for his <unk> theft
Of the great herd , that near him <unk> ’ d ; whence found
His <unk> deeds their end , beneath the <unk>
Of stout Alcides , that perchance laid on
A hundred blows , and not the tenth was felt . ”
While yet he spake , the centaur sped away :
And under us three spirits came , of whom
Nor I nor he was ware , till they exclaim ’ d ;
“ Say who are ye ? ” We then brake off discourse ,
Intent on these alone . I knew them not ;
But , as it <unk> oft , befell , that one
Had need to name another . “ Where , ” said he ,
“ Doth <unk> <unk> ? ” I , for a sign my guide
Should stand attentive , plac ’ d against my lips
The finger lifted . If , O reader ! now
Thou be not apt to <unk> what I tell ,
No marvel ; for myself do scarce allow
The witness of mine eyes . But as I <unk>
Toward them , lo ! a serpent with six feet
Springs forth on one , and fastens full upon him :
His <unk> grasp ’ d the belly , a <unk>
Seiz ’ d on each arm ( while deep in either cheek
He flesh ’ d his fangs ) ; the hinder on the thighs
Were spread , ’ twixt which the tail <unk> curl ’ d
Upon the reins behind . <unk> ne ’ er clasp ’ d
A <unk> ’ d <unk> , as round the other ’ s limbs
The hideous monster <unk> ’ d his own .
Then , as they both had been of burning wax ,
Each <unk> into other , <unk> hues ,
That which was either now was seen no more .
Thus up the <unk> <unk> , ere it burns ,
A brown <unk> glides , not turning yet to black ,
And the clean white expires . The other two
Look ’ d on exclaiming : “ Ah , how dost thou change ,
<unk> ! See ! Thou art nor double now ,
“ Nor only one . ” The two heads now became
One , and two <unk> blended in one form
Appear ’ d , where both were lost . Of the four <unk>
Two arms were made : the belly and the <unk>
The thighs and legs into such members chang ’ d ,
As never eye hath seen . Of former shape
All trace was vanish ’ d . Two yet neither seem ’ d
That image <unk> , and so pass ’ d on
With tardy steps . As underneath the scourge
Of the fierce <unk> , that lays bare the fields ,
Shifting from brake to brake , the <unk> seems
A flash of lightning , if he thwart the road ,
So toward th ’ entrails of the other two
Approaching seem ’ d , an adder all on fire ,
As the dark <unk> , livid and <unk> .
In that part , whence our life is <unk> ’ d first ,
One he transpierc ’ d ; then down before him fell
Stretch ’ d out . The pierced spirit look ’ d on him
But spake not ; <unk> stood motionless and <unk> ’ d ,
As if by sleep or <unk> ’ rous fit assail ’ d .
He ey ’ d the serpent , and the serpent him .
One from the wound , the other from the mouth
Breath ’ d a thick smoke , whose <unk> ’ ry <unk> join ’ d .
Lucan in mute attention now may hear ,
Nor thy disastrous fate , <unk> ! tell ,
Nor shine , <unk> ! <unk> now be mute .
What if in warbling fiction he record
<unk> and <unk> , to a snake
Him chang ’ d , and her into a fountain clear ,
I envy not ; for never face to face
Two natures thus transmuted did he sing ,
Wherein both shapes were ready to <unk>
The other ’ s substance . They in mutual guise
So answer ’ d , that the serpent split his train
Divided to a fork , and the pierc ’ d spirit
Drew close his steps together , legs and thighs
<unk> , that no sign of <unk> soon
Was visible : the tail disparted took
The figure which the spirit lost , its skin
<unk> ’ ning , his <unk> to a rind .
The shoulders next I mark ’ d , that ent ’ ring join ’ d
The monster ’ s <unk> , whose two shorter feet
So lengthen ’ d , as the other ’ s <unk> <unk> .
The feet behind then twisting up became
That part that man conceals , which in the wretch
Was cleft in twain . While both the shadowy smoke
With a new colour veils , and generates
Th ’ <unk> pile on one , <unk> it off
From th ’ other body , lo ! upon his feet
One upright rose , and prone the other fell .
Not yet their <unk> and malignant lamps
Were shifted , though each feature chang ’ d beneath .
Of him who stood erect , the mounting face
<unk> towards the temples , and what there
<unk> matter came , shot out in ears
From the smooth cheeks , the rest , not backward dragg ’ d ,
Of its excess did shape the nose ; and swell ’ d
Into due size <unk> the lips .
He , on the earth who lay , meanwhile extends
His sharpen ’ d visage , and draws down the ears
Into the head , as doth the <unk> his horns .
His tongue <unk> before and apt
For utt ’ rance , severs ; and the other ’ s fork
<unk> unites . That done the smoke was laid .
The soul , transform ’ d into the brute , glides off ,
<unk> along the vale , and after him
The other <unk> <unk> ; but soon turn ’ d
His <unk> shoulders on him , and in few
Thus to another spake : “ Along this path
<unk> , as I have done , speed <unk> now ! ”
So saw I <unk> in successive change
Th ’ <unk> <unk> of the seventh hold :
And here if aught my tongue have <unk> ’ d , <unk>
So strange may be its warrant . O ’ er mine eyes
<unk> hung , and on my thoughts amaze .
Yet ’ scap ’ d they not so <unk> , but well
I mark ’ d <unk> : he alone it was
Of the three first that came , who chang ’ d not : thou ,
The other ’ s fate , <unk> , still dost rue .
CANTO XXVI
Florence <unk> ! for thou so <unk>
Hast <unk> , that o ’ er land and sea thy wings
Thou <unk> , and thy name spreads over hell !
Among the plund ’ rers such the three I found
Thy citizens , whence shame to me thy son ,
And no proud honour to thyself <unk> .
But if our minds , when dreaming near the dawn ,
Are of the truth <unk> , thou ere long
Shalt feel what <unk> , ( not to say the rest )
Would fain might come upon thee ; and that chance
Were in good time , if it befell thee now .
Would so it were , since it must needs befall !
For as time wears me , I shall grieve the more .
We from the depth departed ; and my guide
<unk> scal ’ d the flinty steps , which late
We downward trac ’ d , and drew me up the steep .
Pursuing thus our solitary way
Among the crags and <unk> of the rock ,
Sped not our feet without the help of hands .
Then sorrow seiz ’ d me , which e ’ en now revives ,
As my thought turns again to what I saw ,
And , more than I am wont , I rein and curb
The powers of nature in me , lest they run
Where Virtue guides not ; that if aught of good
My gentle star , or <unk> better gave me ,
I envy not myself the precious boon .
As in that season , when the sun least veils
His face that lightens all , what time the fly
Gives way to the shrill <unk> , the <unk> then
Upon some cliff <unk> ’ d , beneath him sees
<unk> <unk> <unk> o ’ er the vale ,
<unk> or <unk> , where his <unk> lies :
With flames so <unk> throughout its space
Shone the eighth chasm , apparent , when the depth
Was to my view expos ’ d . As he , whose wrongs
The bears <unk> ’ d , at its <unk> saw
<unk> ’ s chariot , when the steeds erect
Rais ’ d their steep flight for heav ’ n ; his eyes meanwhile ,
<unk> pursu ’ d them , till the flame alone
<unk> like a <unk> <unk> he kenn ’ d ;
E ’ en thus along the gulf moves every flame ,
A sinner so <unk> close in each ,
That none <unk> token of the theft .
Upon the bridge I forward bent to look ,
And grasp ’ d a flinty mass , or else had fall ’ n ,
Though push ’ d not from the height . The guide , who mark ’ d
How I did gaze attentive , thus began :
“ Within these <unk> are the spirits , each
<unk> ’ d in <unk> fire . ” — “ Master , thy word , ”
I answer ’ d , “ hath assur ’ d me ; yet I deem ’ d
Already of the truth , already wish ’ d
To ask thee , who is in yon fire , that comes
So parted at the summit , as it seem ’ d
Ascending from that funeral pile , where lay
The Theban brothers ? ” He replied : “ Within
Ulysses there and <unk> endure
Their penal tortures , thus to vengeance now
Together hasting , as erewhile to wrath .
These in the flame with <unk> <unk> deplore
The <unk> of the horse , that open ’ d wide
A portal for that goodly seed to pass ,
Which sow ’ d <unk> Rome ; nor less the guile
<unk> they , whence of her Achilles ’ reft
Deidamia yet in death <unk> .
And there is rued the <unk> , that Troy
Of her <unk> spoil ’ d . ” — “ If they have power
Of utt ’ rance from within these sparks , ” said I ,
“ O master ! think my prayer a thousand fold
In <unk> urg ’ d , that thou vouchsafe
To pause , till here the <unk> flame arrive .
See , how toward it with desire I bend . ”
He thus : “ Thy prayer is worthy of much praise ,
And I <unk> it therefore : but do thou
Thy tongue refrain : to question them be mine ,
For I divine thy wish : and they perchance ,
For they were Greeks , might shun discourse with thee . ”
When there the flame had come , where time and place
Seem ’ d fitting to my guide , he thus began :
“ O ye , who dwell two spirits in one fire !
If living I of you did merit aught ,
Whate ’ er the measure were of that desert ,
When in the world my lofty strain I pour ’ d ,
<unk> ye not on , till one of you unfold
In what clime death o ’ ertook him self-destroy ’ d . ”
Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
Began to roll , <unk> , as a fire
That <unk> with the wind , then to and fro
<unk> the top , as a tongue uttering sounds ,
<unk> out its voice , and spake : “ When I escap ’ d
From Circe , who beyond a circling year
Had held me near <unk> , by her charms ,
Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam ’ d the shore ,
Nor fondness for my son , nor reverence
Of my old father , nor return of love ,
That should have crown ’ d <unk> with joy ,
Could overcome in me the zeal I had
T ’ explore the world , and search the ways of life ,
Man ’ s evil and his virtue . Forth I sail ’ d
Into the deep <unk> main ,
With but one bark , and the small faithful band
That yet <unk> ’ d to me . As <unk> far ,
Far as <unk> either shore I saw ,
And the <unk> and each isle beside
Which round that ocean <unk> . <unk> with age
Were I and my companions , when we came
To the strait pass , where <unk> ordain ’ d
The bound ’ ries not to be o ’ <unk> ’ d by man .
The walls of Seville to my right I left ,
On the other hand already <unk> past .
“ O brothers ! ” I began , “ who to the west
Through perils without number now have reach ’ d ,
To this the short remaining watch , that yet
Our senses have to wake , refuse not proof
Of the <unk> world , following the track
Of <unk> . Call to mind from whence we sprang :
Ye were not form ’ d to live the life of <unk>
But virtue to pursue and knowledge high . ”
With these few words I sharpen ’ d for the voyage
The mind of my associates , that I then
Could scarcely have <unk> them . To the dawn
Our poop we turn ’ d , and for the witless flight
Made our oars wings , still <unk> on the left .
Each star of the other pole night now beheld ,
And ours so low , that from the <unk>
It rose not . Five times <unk> ’ d , as oft
Vanish ’ d the light from underneath the moon
Since the deep way we enter ’ d , when from far
Appear ’ d a mountain dim , <unk> methought
Of all I e ’ er beheld . Joy seiz ’ d us straight ,
But soon to mourning <unk> . From the new land
A whirlwind sprung , and at her foremost side
Did strike the vessel . Thrice it whirl ’ d her round
With all the waves , the fourth time lifted up
The poop , and sank the prow : so fate decreed :
And over us the <unk> billow clos ’ d . ”
CANTO XVII
Now upward rose the flame , and still ’ d its light
To speak no more , and now pass ’ d on with leave
From the mild poet gain ’ d , when following came
Another , from whose top a sound confus ’ d ,
Forth issuing , drew our eyes that way to look .
As the <unk> bull , that <unk>
His cries first <unk> , who had shap ’ d its mould ,
Did so <unk> , with the voice of him
<unk> , that the brazen monster seem ’ d
Pierc ’ d through with pain ; thus while no way they found
Nor <unk> <unk> through the flame ,
Into its language turn ’ d the dismal words :
But soon as they had won their passage forth ,
Up from the point , which <unk> obey ’ d
Their motion at the tongue , these sounds we heard :
“ O thou ! to whom I now direct my voice !
That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase ,
‘ <unk> thou , I <unk> thee no more , ’
Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
Let it not <unk> thee here to pause awhile ,
And with me parley : lo ! it <unk> not me
And yet I burn . If but e ’ en now thou fall
into this blind world , from that pleasant land
Of Latium , whence I draw my sum of guilt ,
Tell me if those , who in Romagna dwell ,
Have peace or war . For of the mountains there
Was I , betwixt <unk> and the height ,
Whence Tyber first <unk> his mighty flood . ”
Leaning I listen ’ d yet with heedful ear ,
When , as he touch ’ d my side , the leader thus :
“ Speak thou : he is a Latian . ” My reply
Was ready , and I spake without delay :
“ O spirit ! who art hidden here below !
Never was thy Romagna without war
In her proud tyrants ’ bosoms , nor is now :
But open war there left I none . The state ,
<unk> hath maintain ’ d this many a year ,
Is steadfast . There <unk> ’ s eagle broods ,
And in his broad <unk> of plume
O ’ <unk> <unk> . The green talons grasp
The land , that stood erewhile the proof so long ,
And pil ’ d in bloody heap the host of France .
“ The old mastiff of <unk> and the young ,
That tore <unk> in their wrath , still make ,
Where they are wont , an <unk> of their fangs .
“ <unk> ’ s city and <unk> ’ s range
Under the lion of the snowy lair .
<unk> <unk> ! that changeth sides ,
Or ever summer yields to winter ’ s frost .
And she , whose flank is wash ’ d of <unk> ’ s wave ,
As ’ twixt the level and the steep she lies ,
Lives so ’ twixt tyrant power and liberty .
“ Now tell us , I entreat thee , who art thou ?
Be not more hard than others . In the world ,
So may thy name still rear its forehead high . ”
Then <unk> ’ d awhile the fire , its sharpen ’ d point
On either side wav ’ d , and thus breath ’ d at last :
“ If I did think , my answer were to one ,
Who ever could return unto the world ,
This flame should rest <unk> . But since ne ’ er ,
If true be told me , any from this depth
Has found his upward way , I answer thee ,
Nor fear lest infamy record the words .
“ A man of arms at first , I cloth ’ d me then
In good Saint Francis ’ girdle , <unk> so
T ’ have made amends . And certainly my hope
Had fail ’ d not , but that he , whom <unk> light on ,
The high priest again <unk> ’ d me into sin .
And how and wherefore listen while I tell .
Long as this spirit mov ’ d the bones and pulp
My mother gave me , less my deeds bespake
The nature of the lion than the fox .
All ways of <unk> subtlety I knew ,
And with such art conducted , that the sound
Reach ’ d the world ’ s limit . Soon as to that part
Of life I found me come , when each behoves
To lower sails and gather in the lines ;
That which before had <unk> me then I rued ,
And to repentance and confession turn ’ d ;
<unk> that I was ! and well it had <unk> me !
The chief of the new Pharisees meantime ,
<unk> his warfare near the <unk> ,
Not with the Saracens or Jews ( his foes
All Christians were , nor against <unk> one
Had fought , nor <unk> ’ d in the Soldan ’ s land ) ,
He his great charge nor sacred <unk>
In himself , rev ’ <unk> ’ d , nor in me that cord ,
Which us ’ d to mark with leanness whom it <unk> .
As in <unk> , Constantine besought
To cure his <unk> <unk> ’ s aid ,
So me to cure the fever of his pride
This man besought : my counsel to that end
He ask ’ d : and I was silent : for his words
Seem ’ d <unk> : but forthwith he thus resum ’ d :
“ From thy heart <unk> fear : of all offence
I <unk> absolve thee . In return ,
<unk> me my purpose so to execute ,
That <unk> cumber earth no more .
Heav ’ n , as thou knowest , I have power to shut
And open : and the keys are therefore twain ,
The which my <unk> meanly priz ’ d . ”
Then , <unk> to the <unk> arguments ,
Of silence as more perilous I deem ’ d ,
And answer ’ d : “ Father ! since thou <unk> me
Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall ,
Large promise with performance scant , be sure ,
Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat . ”
“ When I was number ’ d with the dead , then came
Saint Francis for me ; but a <unk> dark
He met , who cried : “ ‘ <unk> me not ; he is mine ,
And must below to join the wretched crew ,
For the deceitful counsel which he gave .
E ’ er since I watch ’ d him , hov ’ ring at his hair ,
No power can the <unk> absolve ;
Nor to repent and will at once <unk> ,
By <unk> absolute <unk> . ”
Oh mis ’ ry ! how I shook myself , when he
Seiz ’ d me , and cried , “ Thou haply thought ’ st me not
A <unk> in <unk> so exact . ”
To Minos down he bore me , and the judge
<unk> ’ d <unk> times round his callous back the tail ,
Which biting with excess of rage , he spake :
‘ This is a <unk> soul , that in the fire
Must vanish . ’ Hence <unk> ’ d I <unk>
A prey to <unk> sorrow in this garb . ”
When he had thus fulfill ’ d his words , the flame
In dolour parted , beating to and fro ,
And writhing its sharp horn . We onward went ,
I and my leader , up along the rock ,
Far as another arch , that <unk>
The foss , wherein the penalty is paid
Of those , who load them with committed sin .
CANTO XXVIII
Who , e ’ en in words unfetter ’ d , might at full
Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw ,
Though he <unk> oft the tale ? No tongue
So vast a theme could equal , speech and thought
Both <unk> alike . If in one band
Collected , stood the people all , who e ’ er
Pour ’ d on <unk> ’ s happy soil their blood ,
<unk> by the <unk> , and in that long war
When of the rings the measur ’ d <unk> made
A pile so high , as Rome ’ s <unk> <unk>
Who <unk> not , with the multitude , that felt
The <unk> force of <unk> ’ s <unk> steel ,
And those the rest , whose bones are gather ’ d yet
At <unk> , there where treachery
<unk> th ’ <unk> name , or where beyond
Thy walls , O <unk> , without arms
The old <unk> conquer ’ d ; and his limbs
One were to show transpierc ’ d , another his
<unk> <unk> away ; a spectacle like this
Were but a thing of nought , to the hideous sight
Of the <unk> chasm . A <unk> , that hath lost
Its middle or side <unk> , gapes not so wide ,
As one I mark ’ d , torn from the chin throughout
Down to the hinder passage : ’ twixt the legs
<unk> his entrails hung , the <unk> lay
Open to view , and wretched <unk> ,
That turns th ’ <unk> aliment to <unk> .
Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze ,
He ey ’ d me , with his hands laid his breast bare ,
And cried ; “ Now mark how I do <unk> me ! lo !
“ How is Mohammed mangled ! before me
Walks <unk> weeping , from the chin his face
<unk> to the <unk> ; and the others all
Whom here thou seest , while they liv ’ d , did sow
<unk> and <unk> , and therefore thus are rent .
A fiend is here behind , who with his sword
<unk> us thus <unk> , <unk> again
Each of this <unk> , when we have <unk> round
The dismal way , for first our gashes close
Ere we repass before him . But say who
Art thou , that standest musing on the rock ,
Haply so lingering to delay the pain
<unk> ’ d upon thy crimes ? ” — “ Him death not yet , ”
My guide rejoin ’ d , “ hath overta ’ en , nor sin
<unk> to torment ; but , that he may make
Full trial of your state , I who am dead
Must through the depths of hell , from orb to orb ,
Conduct him . <unk> my words , for they are true . ”
More than a hundred spirits , when that they heard ,
Stood in the foss to mark me , through <unk> ,
Forgetful of their pangs . “ Thou , who perchance
Shalt <unk> view the sun , this warning thou
<unk> to <unk> : bid him , if he wish not
Here soon to follow me , that with good store
Of food he arm him , lest <unk> ’ ning <unk>
<unk> him a victim to <unk> ’ s power ,
No easy conquest else . ” With foot uprais ’ d
For <unk> , spake Mohammed , on the ground
Then fix ’ d it to depart . Another shade ,
Pierc ’ d in the throat , his nostrils <unk>
E ’ en from beneath the <unk> , and one ear
<unk> off , who with the rest through wonder stood
Gazing , before the rest advanc ’ d , and bar ’ d
His <unk> , that without was all o ’ <unk> ’ d
With crimson stain . “ O thou ! ” said ‘ he , “ whom sin
<unk> not , and whom erst ( unless too near
<unk> do deceive me ) I aloft
Have seen on Latian ground , call thou to mind
Piero of <unk> , if again
Returning , thou behold ’ st the pleasant land
That from <unk> slopes to <unk> ;
“ And there instruct the twain , whom Fano boasts
Her <unk> sons , Guido and <unk> ,
That if ’ t is giv ’ n us here to scan aright
The future , they out of life ’ s <unk>
Shall be cast forth , and whelm ’ d under the waves
Near to <unk> , through <unk>
Of a fell tyrant . ’ Twixt the <unk> isle
And <unk> , ne ’ er hath <unk> seen
An injury so foul , by <unk> done
Or <unk> crew of old . That <unk> ’ d traitor
( Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
His eye had still lack ’ d sight of ) them shall bring
To conf ’ rence with him , then so shape his end ,
That they shall need not ’ gainst <unk> ’ s wind
<unk> up vow nor pray ’ r . ” I answering thus :
“ Declare , as thou dost wish that I above
May carry tidings of thee , who is he ,
In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance ? ”
Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone
Of one , his <unk> , and his jaws
Expanding , cried : “ Lo ! this is he I <unk> of ;
He speaks not for himself : the <unk> this
Who overwhelm ’ d the doubt in Caesar ’ s mind ,
<unk> that delay to men prepar ’ d
Was ever harmful . “ Oh how terrified
Methought was <unk> , from whose throat was cut
The tongue , which spake that hardy word . Then one
Maim ’ d of each hand , uplifted in the gloom
The bleeding <unk> , that they with <unk> spots
<unk> his face , and cried : ‘ Remember thee
Of Mosca , too , I who , alas ! exclaim ’ d ,
“ The deed once done there is an end , ” that prov ’ d
A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race . ”
I added : “ Ay , and death to thine own tribe . ”
Whence <unk> woe on woe he hurried off ,
As one <unk> to madness . But I there
Still linger ’ d to behold the troop , and saw
Things , such as I may fear without more proof
To tell of , but that conscience makes me firm ,
The boon companion , who her strong <unk>
<unk> on him , that feels no guilt within
And bids him on and fear not . Without doubt
I saw , and yet it seems to pass before me ,
A <unk> trunk , that even as the rest
Of the sad flock pac ’ d onward . By the hair
It bore the sever ’ d <unk> , <unk>
<unk> in hand , which look ’ d at us and said ,
“ Woe ’ s me ! ” The spirit lighted thus himself ,
And two there were in one , and one in two .
How that may be he knows who <unk> so .
When at the bridge ’ s foot direct he stood ,
His arm aloft he rear ’ d , thrusting the head
Full in our view , that nearer we might hear
The words , which thus it utter ’ d : “ Now behold
This grievous torment , thou , who breathing go ’ st
To spy the dead ; behold if any else
Be terrible as this . And that on earth
Thou mayst bear tidings of me , know that I
Am <unk> , he of Born , who gave King John
The counsel <unk> . Father and son
I set at mutual war . For <unk>
And David more did not <unk> ,
<unk> them on <unk> to strife .
For parting those so closely knit , my brain
Parted , alas ! I carry from its source ,
That in this trunk inhabits . Thus the law
Of <unk> <unk> works in me . ”
CANTO XXIX
So were mine eyes <unk> with view
Of the vast multitude , whom various wounds
<unk> ’ d , that they long ’ d to stay and weep .
But Virgil rous ’ d me : “ What yet <unk> on ?
Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
Among the maim ’ d and miserable shades ?
Thou hast not <unk> in any chasm beside
This weakness . Know , if thou wouldst number them
That two and <unk> miles the valley winds
Its circuit , and already is the moon
Beneath our feet : the time permitted now
Is short , and more not seen remains to see . ”
“ If thou , ” I straight replied , “ hadst weigh ’ d the cause
For which I look ’ d , thou hadst perchance <unk> ’ d
The tarrying still . ” My leader part pursu ’ d
His way , the while I follow ’ d , answering him ,
And <unk> thus : “ Within that cave I deem ,
Whereon so fixedly I held my ken ,
There is a spirit dwells , one of my blood ,
Wailing the crime that <unk> him now so dear . ”
Then spake my master : “ Let thy soul no more
<unk> itself for him . Direct elsewhere
Its thought , and leave him . At the bridge ’ s foot
I mark ’ d how he did point with <unk> look
At thee , and heard him by the others nam ’ d
<unk> of <unk> . Thou so wholly then
<unk> busied with his spirit , who once rul ’ d
The towers of <unk> , that thou <unk> not
That way , ere he was gone . ” — “ O guide belov ’ d !
His violent death yet <unk> ’ d , ” said I ,
“ By any , who are partners in his shame ,
Made him <unk> : therefore , as I think ,
He pass ’ d me <unk> by ; and <unk> so
Hath made me more <unk> his fate . ”
So we <unk> ’ d to where the rock first show ’ d
The other valley , had more light been there ,
E ’ en to the lowest depth . Soon as we came
O ’ er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
Of Malebolge , and the <unk>
Were to our view expos ’ d , then many a dart
Of sore lament assail ’ d me , <unk> all
With points of <unk> pity , that I clos ’ d
Both ears against the volley with mine hands .
As were the torment , if each <unk>
Of <unk> , in the sultry time
’ Twixt <unk> and September , with the isle
Sardinia and Maremma ’ s pestilent fen ,
Had heap ’ d their <unk> all in one foss
Together ; such was here the torment : dire
The stench , as issuing <unk> from <unk> ’ d limbs .
We on the utmost shore of the long rock
Descended still to leftward . Then my sight
Was livelier to explore the depth , wherein
The minister of the most mighty Lord ,
<unk> Justice , dooms to punishment
The <unk> noted on her dread record .
More rueful was it not methinks to see
The nation in <unk> droop , what time
Each living thing , e ’ en to the little worm ,
All fell , so full of malice was the air
( And afterward , as bards of yore have told ,
The ancient people were restor ’ d anew
From seed of emmets ) than was here to see
The spirits , that languish ’ d through the murky vale
<unk> ’ d on many a <unk> . <unk> ’ d they lay ,
One o ’ er the belly , o ’ er the shoulders one
Roll ’ d of another ; <unk> <unk> ’ d a third
Along the dismal pathway . <unk> by step
We journey ’ d on , in silence looking round
And list ’ ning those <unk> ’ d , who strove in vain
To lift their forms . Then two I mark ’ d , that sat
<unk> ’ d ’ gainst each other , as two brazen <unk>
Set to retain the heat . From head to foot ,
A <unk> bark ’ d them round . Nor saw I e ’ er
<unk> <unk> so fast , for whom his lord
Impatient waited , or himself perchance
Tir ’ d with long watching , as of these each one
<unk> quickly his keen nails , through <unk>
Of ne ’ er <unk> <unk> . The crust
Came drawn from underneath in flakes , like scales
<unk> ’ d from the <unk> or fish of <unk> <unk> .
“ O thou , who with thy fingers <unk> off
Thy coat of proof , ” thus spake my guide to one ,
“ And sometimes <unk> tearing <unk> of them ,
Tell me if any born of Latian land
Be among these within : so may thy nails
<unk> thee for everlasting to this toil . ”
“ Both are of Latium , ” weeping he replied ,
“ Whom tortur ’ d thus thou seest : but who art thou
That hast inquir ’ d of us ? ” To whom my guide :
“ One that descend with this man , who yet lives ,
From rock to rock , and show him hell ’ s abyss . ”
Then <unk> they asunder , and each turn ’ d
<unk> toward us , with the rest , whose ear
Those words <unk> struck . To me my liege
Address ’ d him : “ Speak to them whate ’ er thou list . ”
And I therewith began : “ So may no time
<unk> your remembrance from the thoughts of men
In th ’ upper world , but after many suns
<unk> it , as ye tell me , who ye are ,
And of what race ye come . Your punishment ,
<unk> and disgustful in its kind ,
<unk> you not from opening thus much to me . ”
“ Arezzo was my dwelling , ” answer ’ d one ,
“ And me <unk> of Sienna brought
To die by fire ; but that , for which I died ,
Leads me not here . True is in sport I told him ,
That I had learn ’ d to wing my flight in air .
And he <unk> much , as he was void
Of wisdom , will ’ d me to declare to him
The secret of mine art : and only hence ,
Because I made him not a <unk> ,
<unk> ’ d on one <unk> ’ d his sire to burn me .
But Minos to this chasm last of the ten ,
For that I practis ’ d alchemy on earth ,
Has doom ’ d me . Him no <unk> eludes . ”
Then to the bard I spake : “ Was ever race
Light as Sienna ’ s ? <unk> not France herself
Can show a tribe so <unk> and vain . ”
The other leprous spirit heard my words ,
And thus return ’ d : “ Be <unk> from this charge
Exempted , he who knew so <unk> ’ <unk>
To lay out fortune ’ s gifts ; and <unk>
Who first the <unk> ’ s <unk> luxury
Discover ’ d in that garden , where such seed
<unk> <unk> in the soil : and be that troop
Exempted , with whom <unk> of <unk>
<unk> ’ d his <unk> and <unk> woods ,
And his rare wisdom <unk> show ’ d
A spectacle for all . That thou mayst know
Who <unk> thee against the <unk>
Thus gladly , bend this way thy sharpen ’ d sight ,
That well my face may answer to thy ken ;
So shalt thou see I am Capocchio ’ s ghost ,
Who <unk> ’ d transmuted metals by the power
Of alchemy ; and if I scan thee right ,
Thus needs must well remember how I <unk>
<unk> nature by my subtle art . ”
CANTO XXX
What time resentment burn ’ d in <unk> ’ s breast
For <unk> against the Theban blood ,
As more than once in dire <unk> was rued ,
Such fatal <unk> seiz ’ d on <unk> ,
That he his spouse beholding with a babe
<unk> on either arm , “ <unk> out , ” he cried ,
“ The <unk> , that I take the <unk>
And the young lions at the pass : ” then forth
Stretch ’ d he his merciless talons , <unk> one ,
One helpless innocent , <unk> nam ’ d ,
Whom <unk> down he dash ’ d upon a rock ,
And with her other burden self-destroy ’ d
The <unk> mother plung ’ d : and when the pride
Of <unk> Troy fell from its height ,
By fortune overwhelm ’ d , and the old king
With his realm perish ’ d , then did <unk> ,
A wretch forlorn and captive , when she saw
<unk> first slaughter ’ d , and her son ,
Her <unk> , on the wild <unk>
Next met the <unk> ’ s view , then reft of sense
Did she run barking even as a dog ;
Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul .
<unk> ne ’ er the <unk> or of Thebes or Troy
With such fell cruelty were seen , their goads
<unk> in the limbs of man or beast ,
As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
That <unk> wildly <unk> ’ d , like the swine
<unk> from his <unk> . One reach ’ d Capocchio ,
And in the <unk> <unk> deep his fangs ,
<unk> ’ d him , that o ’ er the solid <unk> <unk> ’ d
His belly stretch ’ d out prone . The other shape ,
He of Arezzo , there left trembling , spake ;
“ That <unk> of air is <unk> ; in like mood
Of random mischief <unk> he still his spite . ”
To whom I answ ’ ring : “ Oh ! as thou dost hope ,
The other may not flesh its jaws on thee ,
Be <unk> to inform us , who it is ,
Ere it speed hence . ” — “ That is the ancient soul
Of wretched <unk> , ” he replied , “ who burn ’ d
With most <unk> flame for her own sire ,
“ And a false shape <unk> , so perform ’ d
The deed of sin ; e ’ en as the other there ,
That onward passes , dar ’ d to counterfeit
<unk> ’ s features , to feign ’ d <unk>
The seal <unk> , that himself might gain ,
For his own share , the lady of the herd . ”
When vanish ’ d the two furious shades , on whom
Mine eye was held , I turn ’ d it back to view
The other cursed spirits . One I saw
In fashion like a <unk> , had but the <unk>
Been sever ’ d , where it meets the forked part .
Swoln <unk> , <unk> the limbs
With <unk> moisture , that the paunch
Suits not the visage , open ’ d wide his lips
<unk> as in the <unk> man for drought ,
One towards the chin , the other upward curl ’ d .
“ O ye , who in this world of misery ,
Wherefore I know not , are exempt from pain , ”
Thus he began , “ <unk> regard
Adamo ’ s woe . When living , full supply
Ne ’ er lack ’ d me of what most I coveted ;
One drop of water now , alas ! I crave .
The rills , that glitter down the <unk> slopes
Of Casentino , making fresh and soft
The banks whereby they glide to Arno ’ s stream ,
Stand ever in my view ; and not in vain ;
For more the <unk> ’ d semblance <unk> me up ,
Much more than the <unk> , which makes the flesh
Desert these shrivel ’ d cheeks . So from the place ,
Where I <unk> ’ d , stern justice urging me ,
Takes means to quicken more my lab ’ ring sighs .
There is <unk> , where I <unk>
The metal with the Baptist ’ s form <unk> ,
For which on earth I left my body <unk> .
But if I here might see the <unk> soul
Of Guido , <unk> , or their brother ,
For <unk> ’ s limpid spring I would not change
The welcome sight . One is e ’ en now within ,
If truly the mad spirits tell , that round
Are wand ’ ring . But wherein <unk> me that ?
My limbs are fetter ’ d . Were I but so light ,
That I each hundred years might move one <unk> ,
I had set forth already on this path ,
<unk> him out amidst the shapeless crew ,
Although <unk> miles it wind , not more
Than half of one across . They brought me down
Among this tribe ; induc ’ d by them I stamp ’ d
The <unk> with three <unk> of <unk> . ”
“ Who are that abject pair , ” I next inquir ’ d ,
“ That closely bounding thee upon thy right
<unk> <unk> , like a band in winter steep ’ d
In the chill stream ? ” — “ When to this gulf I <unk> , ”
He answer ’ d , “ here I found them ; since that hour
They have not turn ’ d , nor ever shall , I ween ,
Till time hath run his course . One is that dame
The false <unk> of the Hebrew youth ;
Sinon the other , that false Greek from Troy .
<unk> fever <unk> the <unk> moistness out ,
In such a cloud <unk> ’ d . ” When that he heard ,
One , gall ’ d perchance to be so darkly nam ’ d ,
With <unk> ’ d hand smote him on the <unk> paunch ,
That like a <unk> resounded : but forthwith
Adamo smote him on the face , the blow
Returning with his arm , that seem ’ d as hard .
“ Though my o ’ <unk> limbs have ta ’ en from me
The power to move , ” said he , “ I have an arm
At liberty for such employ . ” To whom
Was answer ’ d : “ When thou <unk> to the fire ,
Thou hadst it not so ready at command ,
Then readier when it coin ’ d th ’ <unk> gold . ”
And thus the <unk> : “ Ay , now speak ’ st thou true .
But there thou gav ’ st not such true <unk> ,
When thou wast question ’ d of the truth , at Troy . ”
“ If I spake false , thou falsely stamp ’ dst the coin , ”
Said Sinon ; “ I am here but for one fault ,
And thou for more than any imp beside . ”
“ Remember , ” he replied , “ O <unk> ’ d one ,
The horse remember , that did <unk> with death ,
And all the world be witness to thy guilt . ”
“ To thine , ” return ’ d the Greek , “ witness the thirst
Whence thy tongue <unk> , witness the <unk> mound ,
<unk> ’ d by thy belly up before thine eyes ,
A mass corrupt . ” To whom the <unk> thus :
“ Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
Its evil saying . Me if thirst <unk> ,
Yet I am <unk> ’ d with moisture . Thou art parch ’ d ,
<unk> rack thy head , no urging would ’ st thou need
To make thee lap <unk> ’ mirror up . ”
I was all fix ’ d to listen , when my guide
Admonish ’ d : “ Now beware : a little more ,
And I do <unk> with thee . ” I perceiv ’ d
How angrily he spake , and towards him turn ’ d
With shame so <unk> , as remember ’ d yet
<unk> me . As a man that dreams of harm
<unk> ’ n him , dreaming wishes it a dream ,
And that which is , desires as if it were not ,
Such then was I , who wanting power to speak
<unk> ’ d to <unk> myself , and all the while
<unk> ’ d me , though unweeting that I did .
“ More grievous fault than thine has been , less shame , ”
My master cried , “ might <unk> . Therefore cast
All sorrow from thy soul ; and if again
<unk> bring thee , where like <unk> is held ,
Think I am ever at thy side . To hear
Such <unk> is a joy for <unk> minds . ”
CANTO XXXI
The very tongue , whose keen reproof before
Had <unk> me , that either cheek was stain ’ d ,
Now minister ’ d my cure . So have I heard ,
Achilles and his father ’ s <unk> caus ’ d
Pain first , and then the boon of <unk> restor ’ d .
Turning our back upon the vale of woe ,
<unk> cross ’ d th ’ <unk> mound in silence . There
Was twilight dim , that far long the gloom
Mine eye advanc ’ d not : but I heard a horn
<unk> aloud . The <unk> it blew had made
The thunder feeble . Following its course
The adverse way , my <unk> eyes were bent
On that one spot . So terrible a blast
<unk> blew not , when that dismal rout
O ’ <unk> the host of <unk> , and quench ’ d
His saintly warfare . Thitherward not long
My head was rais ’ d , when many lofty towers
Methought I spied . “ Master , ” said I , “ what land
Is this ? ” He answer ’ d straight : “ Too long a space
Of intervening darkness has thine eye
To traverse : thou hast therefore widely err ’ d
In thy <unk> . Thither arriv ’ d
Thou well shalt see , how distance can <unk>
The sense . A little therefore urge thee on . ”
Then <unk> he caught me by the hand ;
“ Yet know , ” said he , “ ere farther we advance ,
That it less strange may seem , these are not towers ,
But giants . In the pit they stand immers ’ d ,
Each from his <unk> downward , round the bank . ”
As when a fog <unk> <unk> ,
Our vision traces what the mist involves
<unk> ’ d in air ; so piercing through the gross
And gloomy atmosphere , as more and more
We near ’ d toward the brink , mine error fled ,
And fear came o ’ er me . As with circling round
Of <unk> , <unk> <unk> his walls ,
E ’ en thus the shore , encompassing th ’ abyss ,
Was <unk> with giants , half their length
<unk> , horrible , whom Jove from heav ’ n
Yet <unk> , when his <unk> ’ ring thunder rolls .
Of one already I descried the face ,
<unk> , and breast , and of the belly huge
Great part , and both arms down along his ribs .
<unk> nature , when her plastic hand
<unk> <unk> of these <unk> , did display
Past doubt her wisdom , taking from mad <unk>
Such slaves to do his bidding ; and if she
<unk> her not of th ’ <unk> and <unk> ,
Who <unk> well confesses her therein
<unk> and more discreet ; for when brute force
And evil will are back ’ d with subtlety ,
<unk> none avails . His visage seem ’ d
In length and bulk , as doth the pine , that <unk>
Saint Peter ’ s Roman fane ; and th ’ other bones
Of like proportion , so that from above
The bank , which <unk> him below , such height
<unk> his stature , that three <unk>
Had <unk> ’ n in vain to reach but to his hair .
Full <unk> ample palms was he expos ’ d
Downward from whence a man his garments <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ”
So shouted his fierce lips , which sweeter <unk>
<unk> not ; and my guide address ’ d him thus :
“ O <unk> spirit ! let thy horn for thee
<unk> : therewith vent thy rage , if rage
Or other passion <unk> thee . Search thy neck ,
There shalt thou find the <unk> that binds it on .
<unk> spirit ! lo , upon thy mighty breast
Where hangs the <unk> ! ” Then to me he spake :
“ He doth <unk> himself . Nimrod is this ,
Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
One tongue <unk> . But pass we on , nor waste
Our words ; for so each language is to him ,
As his to others , understood by none . ”
Then to the leftward turning sped we forth ,
And at a <unk> ’ s throw found another shade
Far fiercer and more huge . I cannot say
What master hand had girt him ; but he held
Behind the right arm fetter ’ d , and before
The other with a chain , that fasten ’ d him
From the neck down , and five times round his form
<unk> met the <unk> <unk> . “ This proud one
Would of his strength against <unk> Jove
Make trial , ” said my guide ; “ whence he is thus
<unk> : Ephialtes him they call .
“ Great was his prowess , when the giants brought
Fear on the gods : those arms , which then he <unk> ,
Now moves he never . ” Forthwith I return ’ d :
“ <unk> would I , if ’ t were possible , mine eyes
Of Briareus <unk> gain ’ d
Experience next . ” He answer ’ d : “ Thou shalt see
Not far from hence Antaeus , who both speaks
And is unfetter ’ d , who shall place us there
Where guilt is at its depth . Far onward stands
Whom thou wouldst fain behold , in chains , and made
Like to this spirit , save that in his looks
More fell he seems . ” By violent earthquake rock ’ d
Ne ’ er shook a tow ’ r , so <unk> to its base ,
As Ephialtes . More than ever then
I <unk> death , nor than the terror more
Had needed , if I had not seen the cords
That held him fast . We , straightway journeying on ,
Came to Antaeus , who five <unk> complete
Without the head , forth issued from the cave .
“ O thou , who in the fortunate vale , that made
Great <unk> heir of glory , when his sword
Drove back the troop of <unk> in flight ,
Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
An hundred lions ; and if thou hadst fought
In the high conflict on thy brethren ’ s side ,
Seems as men yet believ ’ d , that through thine arm
The sons of earth had conquer ’ d , now vouchsafe
To place us down beneath , where numbing cold
<unk> up Cocytus . Force not that we crave
Or <unk> ’ help or <unk> ’ s . Here is one
Can give what in this realm ye covet . <unk>
Therefore , nor <unk> <unk> thy lip .
He in the upper world can yet bestow
<unk> on thee , for he doth live , and looks
For life yet longer , if before the time
Grace call him not unto herself . ” Thus spake
The teacher . He in haste forth stretch ’ d his hands ,
And caught my guide . Alcides <unk> felt
That grapple straighten ’ d <unk> . Soon as my guide
Had felt it , he bespake me thus : “ This way
That I may clasp thee ; ” then so caught me up ,
That we were both one burden . As appears
The tower of <unk> , from beneath
Where it doth lean , if chance a passing cloud
So sail across , that opposite it hangs ,
Such then Antaeus seem ’ d , as at mine ease
I mark ’ d him stooping . I were fain at times
T ’ have pass ’ d another way . Yet in th ’ abyss ,
That Lucifer with Judas low <unk> ,
lightly he plac ’ d us ; nor there leaning stay ’ d ,
But rose as in a bark the stately mast .

Such <unk> , and with <unk> ’ ring awe I touch
The mighty theme ; for to describe the depth
Of all the universe , is no emprize
To <unk> with , and <unk> a tongue not us ’ d
To infant <unk> . But let them assist
My song , the tuneful maidens , by whose aid

In such a <unk> , as scarce thought finds words

Still on the lofty <unk> , a voice

Good heed , thy soles do tread not on the heads

The very hairs were mingled . “ Tell me ye ,

“ Who are ye ? ” At that sound their necks they bent ,
And when their looks were lifted up to me ,
Straightway their eyes , before all moist within ,

The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there .
<unk> unto <unk> hath never <unk> clos ’ d up
So stoutly . Whence like two <unk> goats
They <unk> ’ d together ; them such fury seiz ’ d .
And one , from whom the cold both ears had reft ,
Exclaim ’ d , still looking downward : “ Why on us

At that one blow <unk> ’ d , not <unk> ,
No not this spirit , whose o ’ <unk> head

Of <unk> : Tuscan if thou be ,
Well knowest who he was : and to cut short
All further question , in my form behold

Then mark ’ d I , which the keen and eager cold
Had shap ’ d into a <unk> <unk> ; whence <unk>
A <unk> ’ ring horror o ’ er me , at the thought
Of those <unk> shallows . While we journey ’ d on
Toward the middle , at whose point unites
All heavy substance , and I trembling went
Through that eternal <unk> , I know not
If will it were or destiny , or chance ,
But , passing ’ midst the heads , my foot did strike
With violent blow against the face of one .
“ Wherefore dost <unk> me ? ” weeping , he exclaim ’ d ,
“ Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
For <unk> , wherefore <unk> me ? ”
I thus : “ Instructor , now await me here ,
That I through him may rid me of my doubt .
Thenceforth what haste thou wilt . ” The teacher paus ’ d ,
And to that shade I spake , who <unk>
Still curs ’ d me in his wrath . “ What art thou , speak ,
That <unk> thus on others ? ” He replied :
“ Now who art thou , that <unk> others ’ cheeks
Through <unk> <unk> , with such force
As were past suff ’ rance , wert thou living still ? ”
“ And I am living , to thy joy perchance , ”
Was my reply , “ if fame be dear to thee ,
That with the rest I may thy name <unk> . ”
“ The contrary of what I covet most , ”
Said he , “ thou tender ’ st : hence ; nor vex me more .
Ill knowest thou to <unk> in this vale . ”
Then <unk> on his hinder <unk> , I cried :
“ <unk> thee , or not a hair shall tarry here . ”
“ <unk> all away , ” he answer ’ d , “ yet for that
I will not tell nor show thee who I am ,
Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times . ”
Now I had grasp ’ d his tresses , and stript off
More than one <unk> , he barking , with his eyes
Drawn in and downward , when another cried ,
“ What ails thee , <unk> ? Sound not loud enough
Thy <unk> ’ ring teeth , but thou must bark <unk> ?
“ What devil wrings thee ? ” — “ Now , ” said I , “ be dumb ,
<unk> traitor ! to thy shame of thee
True tidings will I bear . ” — “ Off , ” he replied ,
“ Tell what thou list ; but as thou escape from hence
To speak of him whose tongue hath been so <unk> ,
<unk> not : here he wails the <unk> ’ s gold .
‘ Him of <unk> , ’ thou canst say , ‘ I mark ’ d ,
Where the <unk> ’ d sinners pine . ’ If thou be ask ’ d
What other shade was with them , at thy side
Is <unk> , whose red gorge <unk> ’ d
The biting <unk> of Florence . Farther on ,
If I <unk> not , <unk> bides ,
With <unk> , and <unk> , him
Who op ’ d Faenza when the people slept . ”
We now had left him , passing on our way ,
When I beheld two spirits by the ice
Pent in one hollow , that the head of one
Was <unk> unto the other ; and as bread
Is <unk> ’ d up through hunger , th ’ <unk>
Did so apply his fangs to th ’ other ’ s brain ,
Where the <unk> joins it . Not more <unk>
On <unk> ’ temples <unk> gnaw ’ d ,
Than on that skull and on its <unk> he .
“ O thou who show ’ st so <unk> sign of hate
’ Gainst him thou prey ’ st on , let me hear , ” said I
“ The cause , on such condition , that if right
<unk> thy <unk> , knowing who ye are ,
And what the colour of his sinning was ,
I may <unk> thee in the world above ,
If that wherewith I speak be moist so long . ”
CANTO XXXIII
His jaws uplifting from their fell <unk> ,
That sinner <unk> ’ d them on the hairs o ’ th ’ head ,
Which he behind had mangled , then began :
“ Thy will <unk> , I call up afresh
<unk> past cure , which but to think of wrings
My heart , or ere I tell on ’ t . But if words ,
That I may utter , shall prove seed to bear
Fruit of eternal infamy to him ,
The traitor whom I gnaw at , thou at once
Shalt see me speak and weep . Who thou mayst be
I know not , nor how here below art come :
But Florentine thou <unk> of a truth ,
When I do hear thee . Know I was on earth
Count Ugolino , and th ’ <unk> he
<unk> . Why I neighbour him so close ,
Now list . That through effect of his ill thoughts
In him my trust reposing , I was ta ’ en
And after murder ’ d , need is not I tell .
What therefore thou canst not have heard , that is ,
How cruel was the murder , shalt thou hear ,
And know if he have wrong ’ d me . A small <unk>
Within that <unk> , which for my sake the name
Of famine bears , where others yet must pine ,
Already through its opening sev ’ ral moons
Had shown me , when I slept the evil sleep ,
That from the future tore the curtain off .
This one , methought , as master of the sport ,
<unk> forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
Unto the mountain , which forbids the sight
Of Lucca to the <unk> . With lean <unk>
<unk> and keen , before him rang ’ d
<unk> with <unk> and <unk> .
After short course the father and the sons
Seem ’ d <unk> ’ d and <unk> , and methought I saw
The sharp <unk> gore their sides . When I <unk>
Before the dawn , amid their sleep I heard
My sons ( for they were with me ) weep and ask
For bread . Right cruel art thou , if no pang
Thou feel at <unk> what my heart <unk> ;
And if not now , why use thy tears to flow ?
Now had they waken ’ d ; and the hour drew near
When they were wont to bring us food ; the mind
Of each <unk> him through his dream , and I
Heard , at its <unk> underneath <unk> ’ d up
The horrible tower : whence uttering not a word
I look ’ d upon the visage of my sons .
I wept not : so all stone I felt within .
They wept : and one , my little <unk> , cried :
‘ Thou <unk> so ! Father what ails thee ? ’ Yet
I shed no tear , nor answer ’ d all that day
Nor the next night , until another sun
Came out upon the world . When a faint beam
Had to our <unk> prison made its way ,
And in four <unk> I descry ’ d
The image of my own , on either hand
Through agony I bit , and they who thought
I did it through desire of feeding , rose
O ’ th ’ sudden , and cried , ‘ Father , we should grieve
Far less , if thou wouldst <unk> of us : thou gav ’ st
These weeds of miserable flesh we wear ,
And do thou <unk> them off from us again . ’
Then , not to make them <unk> , I kept down
My spirit in stillness . That day and the next
We all were silent . Ah , <unk> earth !
Why open ’ dst not upon us ? When we came
To the fourth day , then <unk> at my feet
Outstretch ’ d did fling him , crying , ‘ Hast no help
For me , my father ! ’ There he died , and e ’ en
Plainly as thou seest me , saw I the three
Fall one by one ’ twixt the fifth day and sixth :
Whence I betook me now grown blind to <unk>
Over them all , and for three days aloud
Call ’ d on them who were dead . Then <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of grief . ” Thus having spoke ,
Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
He fasten ’ d , like a mastiff ’ s ’ gainst the <unk>
Firm and <unk> . Oh thou Pisa ! shame
Of all the people , who their dwelling make
In that fair region , where th ’ Italian voice
Is heard , since that thy neighbours are so slack
To punish , from their deep <unk> rise
<unk> and <unk> , and <unk> up
The mouth of Arno , that each soul in thee
May perish in the waters ! What if fame
<unk> that thy castles were <unk> ’ d
By Ugolino , yet no right hadst thou
To stretch his children on the rack . For them ,
<unk> , <unk> , and the pair
Of gentle ones , of whom my song hath told ,
Their tender years , thou modern Thebes ! did make
<unk> of guilt . Onward we pass ’ d ,
Where others <unk> ’ d in rugged folds of ice
Not on their feet were turn ’ d , but each revers ’ d .
There very weeping suffers not to weep ;
For at their eyes grief <unk> passage finds
<unk> , and rolling inward turns
For increase of sharp anguish : the first tears
<unk> <unk> ’ d , and like crystal <unk> show ,
Under the <unk> <unk> all the cup .
Now though the cold had from my face dislodg ’ d
Each feeling , as ’ t were callous , yet me seem ’ d
Some breath of wind I felt . “ Whence <unk> this , ”
Said I , “ my master ? Is not here below
All vapour quench ’ d ? ” — “ ‘ Thou shalt be speedily , ”
He answer ’ d , “ where thine eye shall tell thee whence
The cause <unk> of this airy shower . ”
Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn ’ d :
“ O souls so cruel ! that the farthest post
Hath been assign ’ d you , from this face remove
The harden ’ d veil , that I may vent the grief
Impregnate at my heart , some little space
Ere it congeal again ! ” I thus replied :
“ Say who thou wast , if thou wouldst have mine aid ;
And if I <unk> thee not , far down
As to the lowest ice may I descend ! ”
“ The friar <unk> , ” answered he ,
“ Am I , who from the evil garden pluck ’ d
Its fruitage , and am here <unk> , the date
More <unk> for my <unk> . ” — “ <unk> ! ” I exclaim ’ d ,
“ Art thou too dead ! ” — “ How in the world aloft
It <unk> with my body , ” answer ’ d he ,
“ I am right ignorant . Such privilege
Hath <unk> , that ofttimes the soul
<unk> hither , ere by <unk> <unk> ’ d .
And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
The <unk> <unk> that o ’ <unk> mine eyes ,
Know that the soul , that moment she <unk> ,
As I did , yields her body to a fiend
Who after moves and <unk> it at will ,
Till all its time be <unk> ; headlong she
<unk> to this <unk> . And perchance above
Doth yet appear the body of a ghost ,
Who here behind me <unk> . Him thou know ’ st ,
If thou but newly art arriv ’ d below .
The years are many that have pass ’ d away ,
Since to this <unk> Branca Doria came . ”
“ Now , ” answer ’ d I , “ methinks thou <unk> me ,
For Branca Doria never yet hath died ,
But doth all natural <unk> of a man ,
<unk> , <unk> , and sleeps , and <unk> raiment on . ”
He thus : “ Not yet unto that upper foss
By th ’ evil talons <unk> , where the pitch
<unk> boils , had Michael Zanche reach ’ d ,
When this one left a demon in his stead
In his own body , and of one his kin ,
Who with him treachery wrought . But now put forth
Thy hand , and ope mine eyes . ” I op ’ d them not .
Ill <unk> were best courtesy to him .
Ah <unk> ! men <unk> in every way ,
With every <unk> stain ’ d , why from the earth
Are ye not cancel ’ d ? Such an one of yours
I with Romagna ’ s <unk> spirit found ,
As for his <unk> even now in soul
Is in Cocytus plung ’ d , and yet doth seem
In body still alive upon the earth .
CANTO <unk>
“ The banners of Hell ’ s <unk> do come forth
Towards us ; therefore look , ” so spake my guide ,
“ If thou discern him . ” As , when breathes a cloud
Heavy and dense , or when the shades of night
Fall on our hemisphere , seems view ’ d from far
A <unk> , which the blast <unk> <unk> round ,
Such was the fabric then methought I saw ,
To shield me from the wind , forthwith I drew
Behind my guide : no <unk> else was there .
Now came I ( and with fear I bid my strain
Record the marvel ) where the souls were all
Whelm ’ d underneath , <unk> , as through glass
<unk> the <unk> stem . Some prone were laid ,
Others stood upright , this upon the soles ,
That on his head , a third with face to feet
<unk> ’ d like a bow . When to the point we came ,
Whereat my guide was pleas ’ d that I should see
The creature eminent in beauty once ,
He from before me stepp ’ d and made me pause .
“ Lo ! ” he exclaim ’ d , “ lo Dis ! and lo the place ,
Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength . ”
How frozen and how faint I then became ,
Ask me not , reader ! for I write it not ,
Since words would fail to tell thee of my state .
I was not dead nor living . Think thyself
If quick <unk> work in thee at all ,
How I did feel . That <unk> , who <unk>
The realm of sorrow , at mid breast from th ’ ice
Stood forth ; and I in stature am more like
A giant , than the giants are in his arms .
Mark now how great that whole must be , which suits
With such a part . If he were beautiful
As he is hideous now , and yet did <unk>
To scowl upon his Maker , well from him
May all our mis ’ ry flow . Oh what a sight !
How passing strange it seem ’ d , when I did spy
Upon his head three faces : one in front
Of hue vermilion , th ’ other two with this
Midway each shoulder join ’ d and at the <unk> ;
The right ’ twixt wan and yellow seem ’ d : the left
To look on , such as come from whence old Nile
<unk> to the <unk> . Under each shot forth
Two mighty wings , <unk> as became
A bird so vast . <unk> never such I saw
Outstretch ’ d on the wide sea . No plumes had they ,
But were in texture like a <unk> , and these
He <unk> ’ d i ’ th ’ air , that from him issued still
Three winds , wherewith Cocytus to its depth
Was frozen . At six eyes he wept : the tears
Adown three <unk> <unk> ’ d with bloody foam .
At every mouth his teeth a sinner <unk> ’ d
<unk> ’ d as with pond ’ rous <unk> , so that three
Were in this guise tormented . But far more
Than from that <unk> , was the foremost pang ’ d
By the fierce <unk> , whence ofttimes the back
Was stript of all its skin . “ That upper spirit ,
Who hath worse punishment , ” so spake my guide ,
“ Is Judas , he that hath his head within
And plies the feet without . Of th ’ other two ,
Whose heads are under , from the murky jaw
Who hangs , is Brutus : lo ! how he doth <unk>
And speaks not ! Th ’ other <unk> , that appears
So large of limb . But night now <unk> ,
And it is time for parting . All is seen . ”
I <unk> ’ d him round the neck , for so he bade ;
And <unk> time and place , he , when the wings
Enough were op ’ d , caught fast the shaggy sides ,
And down from pile to pile descending stepp ’ d
Between the thick fell and the <unk> ice .
Soon as he reach ’ d the point , whereat the thigh
Upon the swelling of the <unk> turns ,
My leader there with pain and struggling hard
Turn ’ d round his head , where his feet stood before ,
And grappled at the fell , as one who mounts ,
That into hell methought we turn ’ d again .
“ Expect that by such stairs as these , ” thus spake
The teacher , panting like a man <unk> ,
“ We must depart from evil so extreme . ”
Then at a rocky opening issued forth ,
And plac ’ d me on a brink to sit , next join ’ d
With wary step my side . I rais ’ d mine eyes ,
Believing that I Lucifer should see
Where he was lately left , but saw him now
With legs held upward . Let the <unk> sort ,
Who see not what the point was I had pass ’ d ,
<unk> them if sore toil oppress ’ d me then .
“ Arise , ” my master cried , “ upon thy feet .
The way is long , and much <unk> the road ;
And now within one hour and half of noon
The sun returns . ” It was no <unk>
<unk> and luminous wherein we stood ,
But natural <unk> where ill footing was
And scant supply of light . “ Ere from th ’ abyss
I sep ’ rate , ” thus when risen I began ,
“ My guide ! vouchsafe few words to set me free
From error ’ s <unk> . Where is now the ice ?
How standeth he in posture thus revers ’ d ?
And how from eve to morn in space so brief
Hath the sun made his <unk> ? ” He in few
Thus answering spake : “ Thou <unk> thou art still
On th ’ other side the centre , where I grasp ’ d
Th ’ <unk> worm , that <unk> through the world .
Thou wast on th ’ other side , so long as I
Descended ; when I turn ’ d , thou didst o ’ erpass
That point , to which from ev ’ ry part is dragg ’ d
All heavy substance . Thou art now arriv ’ d
Under the hemisphere <unk> to that ,
Which the great <unk> doth overspread ,
And underneath whose canopy expir ’ d
The Man , that was born <unk> , and so liv ’ d .
Thy feet are <unk> on the smallest sphere ,
Whose other aspect is <unk> . <unk>
Here rises , when there evening sets : and he ,
Whose shaggy pile was scal ’ d , yet standeth fix ’ d ,
As at the first . On this part he fell down
From heav ’ n ; and th ’ earth , here prominent before ,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea ,
And to our hemisphere retir ’ d . Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears ,
That sprang aloof . ” There is a place beneath ,
From <unk> as distant , as extends
The vaulted tomb , discover ’ d not by sight ,
But by the sound of brooklet , that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock ,
Which , as it winds with no <unk> course ,
The wave hath <unk> . By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter , to return
To the fair world : and heedless of repose
We <unk> , he first , I following his steps ,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav ’ n
<unk> ’ d through a circular opening in the cave :
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars .
PURGATORY
CANTO I
O ’ er better waves to speed her rapid course
The light bark of my genius lifts the sail ,
Well pleas ’ d to leave so cruel sea behind ;
And of that second region will I sing ,
In which the human spirit from sinful blot
Is purg ’ d , and for ascent to Heaven <unk> .
Here , O ye hallow ’ d Nine ! for in your train
I follow , here the <unk> strain revive ;
Nor let <unk> refuse to sound
A somewhat higher song , of that loud tone ,
Which when the wretched <unk> of <unk> note
Had heard , they of forgiveness lost all hope .
Sweet hue of eastern <unk> , that was spread
O ’ er the serene aspect of the pure air ,
High up as the first circle , to mine eyes
<unk> joy renew ’ d , soon as I ’ scap ’ d
Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom ,
That had mine eyes and bosom fill ’ d with grief .
The radiant planet , that to love invites ,
Made all the orient <unk> , and veil ’ d beneath
The Pisces ’ light , that in his escort came .
To the right hand I turn ’ d , and fix ’ d my mind
On the ’ other pole attentive , where I saw
Four stars ne ’ er seen before save by the ken
Of our first parents . Heaven of their rays
Seem ’ d joyous . O thou <unk> site , bereft
<unk> , and widow ’ d , since of these <unk> ’ d !
As from this view I had desisted , straight
Turning a little tow ’ rds the other pole ,
There from whence now the wain had disappear ’ d ,
I saw an old man standing by my side
Alone , so worthy of rev ’ rence in his look ,
That ne ’ er from son to father more was ow ’ d .
Low down his beard and mix ’ d with hoary white
Descended , like his locks , which parting fell
Upon his breast in double fold . The beams
Of those four luminaries on his face
So <unk> shone , and with such radiance clear
<unk> ’ d it , that I beheld him as the sun .
“ Say who are ye , that <unk> the blind stream ,
Forth from th ’ eternal prison-house have fled ? ”
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes .
“ Who hath conducted , or with <unk> sure
<unk> you <unk> from the depth of night ,
That makes the infernal valley ever black ?
Are the firm <unk> of the dread abyss
Broken , or in high heaven new laws ordain ’ d ,
That thus , condemn ’ d , ye to my <unk> approach ? ”
My guide , then <unk> hold on me , by words
And <unk> given with hand and head ,
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
Due reverence ; then thus to him replied .
“ Not of myself I come ; a Dame from heaven
Descending , had besought me in my charge
To bring . But since thy will <unk> , that more
Our true condition I unfold at large ,
Mine is not to deny thee thy request .
This mortal ne ’ er hath seen the farthest gloom .
But erring by his folly had approach ’ d
So near , that little space was left to turn .
Then , as before I told , I was dispatch ’ d
To work his <unk> , and no way remain ’ d
Save this which I have ta ’ en . I have display ’ d
Before him all the regions of the bad ;
And purpose now those spirits to display ,
That under thy command are purg ’ d from sin .
How I have brought him would be long to say .
From high descends the virtue , by whose aid
I to thy sight and hearing him have led .
Now may our coming please thee . In the search
Of liberty he journeys : that how dear
They know , who for her sake have life refus ’ d .
Thou knowest , to whom death for her was sweet
In <unk> , where thou didst leave those weeds ,
That in the last great day will shine so bright .
For us the ’ eternal <unk> are unmov ’ d :
He breathes , and I am free of Minos ’ power ,
<unk> in that circle where the eyes
Of thy chaste Marcia beam , who still in look
<unk> thee , O hallow ’ d spirit ! to own her shine .
Then by her love we ’ implore thee , let us pass
Through thy sev ’ n regions ; for which best thanks
I for thy favour will to her return ,
If mention there below thou not disdain . ”
“ Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found , ”
He then to him rejoin ’ d , “ while I was there ,
That all she ask ’ d me I was fain to grant .
Now that beyond the ’ accursed stream she dwells ,
She may no longer move me , by that law ,
Which was ordain ’ d me , when I issued thence .
Not so , if Dame from heaven , as thou sayst ,
Moves and directs thee ; then no <unk> needs .
Enough for me that in her name thou ask .
Go therefore now : and with a slender <unk>
See that thou duly <unk> him , and his face
<unk> , till all <unk> stain thou wipe from thence .
For not with eye , by any cloud obscur ’ d ,
Would it be seemly before him to come ,
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven .
This <unk> all around , there far beneath ,
Where the wave beats it , on the <unk> bed
<unk> store of <unk> . No other plant ,
Cover ’ d with leaves , or harden ’ d in its <unk> ,
There lives , not bending to the water ’ s sway .
After , this way return not ; but the sun
Will show you , that now rises , where to take
The mountain in its easiest ascent . ”
He disappear ’ d ; and I myself uprais ’ d
<unk> , and to my guide <unk> close ,
Toward him turn ’ d mine eyes . He thus began ;
“ My son ! <unk> thou my steps pursue .
We must retreat to <unk> , for that way
The champain to its low extreme declines . ”
The dawn had chas ’ d the matin hour of prime ,
Which deaf before it , so that from afar
I spy ’ d the trembling of the ocean stream .
We <unk> ’ d the <unk> plain , as one
Who , wander ’ d from his track , <unk> every step
<unk> in vain till he <unk> the path .
When we had come , where yet the tender dew
<unk> with the sun , and in a place , where fresh
The wind breath ’ d o ’ er it , while it slowly <unk> ;
Both hands extended on the <unk> grass
My master plac ’ d , in graceful act and kind .
Whence I of his intent before <unk> ’ d ,
Stretch ’ d out to him my cheeks <unk> ’ d with tears .
There to my visage he anew restor ’ d
That hue , which the dun shades of hell conceal ’ d .
Then on the solitary shore arriv ’ d ,
That never sailing on its waters saw
Man , that could after measure back his course ,
He girt me in such manner as had pleas ’ d
Him who instructed , and O , strange to tell !
As he <unk> every humble plant ,
<unk> one was pluck ’ d , another there
<unk> , straightway in its place arose .
CANTO II
Now had the sun to that horizon reach ’ d ,
That covers , with the most exalted point
Of its meridian circle , <unk> ’ s walls ,
And night , that opposite to him her orb
Sounds , from the stream of Ganges issued forth ,
Holding the scales , that from her hands are dropp ’ d
When she reigns highest : so that where I was ,
<unk> ’ s white and <unk> ’ d cheek
To orange turn ’ d as she in age increas ’ d .
Meanwhile we linger ’ d by the water ’ s brink ,
Like men , who , musing on their road , in thought
<unk> , while motionless the body rests .
When lo ! as near upon the hour of dawn ,
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
<unk> down in west , over the ocean floor ;
So seem ’ d , what once again I hope to view ,
A light so swiftly coming through the sea ,
No winged course might equal its career .
From which when for a space I had withdrawn
Thine eyes , to make inquiry of my guide ,
Again I look ’ d and saw it grown in size
And brightness : thou on either side appear ’ d
Something , but what I knew not of bright hue ,
And by degrees from underneath it came
Another . My <unk> silent yet
Stood , while the brightness , that we first discern ’ d ,
Open ’ d the form of wings : then when he knew
The pilot , cried aloud , “ Down , down ; bend low
Thy knees ; behold God ’ s angel : fold thy hands :
Now shalt thou see true <unk> indeed . ”
Lo how all human means he sets at naught !
So that nor oar he needs , nor other sail
Except his wings , between such distant shores .
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear ’ d ,
<unk> the air with those eternal plumes ,
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change ! ”
As more and more toward us came , more bright
Appear ’ d the bird of God , nor could the eye
<unk> his splendor near : I mine bent down .
He drove <unk> in a small bark so swift
And light , that in its course no wave it <unk> .
The heav ’ nly steersman at the prow was seen ,
<unk> written blessed in his looks .
Within a hundred spirits and more there sat .
“ In <unk> Israel de <unk> ; ”
All with one voice together sang , with what
In the <unk> of that hymn is writ .
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
He <unk> ’ d them , they at once leap ’ d out on land ,
The swiftly as he came return ’ d . The crew ,
There left , appear ’ d <unk> with the place ,
Gazing around as one who sees new sights .
From every side the sun darted his beams ,
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav ’ n
Had chas ’ d the <unk> , when that strange tribe
Lifting their eyes towards us : “ If ye know ,
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount . ”
Them Virgil answer ’ d . “ Ye <unk> perchance
Us well <unk> with this place : but here ,
We , as yourselves , are <unk> . Not long erst
We came , before you but a little space ,
By other road so rough and hard , that now
The ’ ascent will seem to us as play . ” The spirits ,
Who from my breathing had perceiv ’ d I liv ’ d ,
<unk> pale with wonder . As the multitude
<unk> round a <unk> , sent with olive branch ,
To hear what news he brings , and in their haste
<unk> one another down , e ’ en so at sight
Of me those happy spirits were fix ’ d , each one
Forgetful of its errand , to depart ,
Where <unk> ’ d from sin , it might be made all fair .
Then one I saw darting before the rest
With such fond ardour to embrace me , I
To do the like was mov ’ d . O shadows vain
Except in outward semblance ! thrice my hands
I clasp ’ d behind it , they as oft return ’ d
<unk> into my breast again . <unk>
I needs must think was painted in my looks ,
For that the shadow smil ’ d and backward drew .
To follow it I hasten ’ d , but with voice
Of sweetness it enjoin ’ d me to desist .
Then who it was I knew , and pray ’ d of it ,
To talk with me , it would a little pause .
It answered : “ Thee as in my mortal frame
I lov ’ d , so loos ’ d forth it I love thee still ,
And therefore pause ; but why walkest thou here ? ”
“ Not without purpose once more to return ,
Thou find ’ st me , my <unk> , where I am
<unk> this way ; ” I said , “ but how of thee
Hath so much time been lost ? ” He answer ’ d straight :
“ No <unk> hath been done to me , if he
Who when and whom he chooses takes , me oft
This passage hath denied , since of just will
His will he makes . These three months past indeed ,
He , whose chose to enter , with free leave
Hath taken ; whence I wand ’ ring by the shore
Where Tyber ’ s wave grows salt , of him gain ’ d kind
<unk> , at that river ’ s mouth , tow ’ <unk> which
His wings are pointed , for there always throng
All such as not to <unk> descend . ”
Then I : “ If new laws have not quite destroy ’ d
Memory and use of that sweet song of love ,
That while all my cares had power to ’ <unk> ;
<unk> thee with it a little to <unk>
My spirit , that <unk> ’ d with its frame ,
<unk> so far , of pain is overcome . ”
“ Love that <unk> in my thoughts . ” He then
Began in such soft accents , that within
The sweetness <unk> me yet . My gentle guide
And all who came with him , so well were pleas ’ d ,
That seem ’ d naught else might in their thoughts have room .
Fast fix ’ d in mute attention to his notes
We stood , when lo ! that old man venerable
Exclaiming , “ How is this , ye tardy spirits ?
What <unk> <unk> you loit ’ ring here ?
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales ,
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal . ”
As a wild flock of <unk> , to their food
Collected , blade or <unk> , without their pride
<unk> ’ d , and in still and quiet sort ,
If aught alarm them , suddenly desert
Their <unk> , assail ’ d by more <unk> care ;
So I that <unk> troop beheld , the song
<unk> , hasten to the mountain ’ s side ,
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not .
Nor with less hurried step did we depart .
CANTO III
Them sudden flight had scatter ’ d over the plain ,
Turn ’ d tow ’ rds the mountain , whither reason ’ s voice
<unk> us ; I to my faithful company
<unk> , left it not . For how of him
Depriv ’ d , might I have sped , or who beside
Would o ’ er the <unk> tract have led my steps
He with the bitter pang of <unk>
Seem ’ d smitten . O clear conscience and upright
How doth a little fling wound thee sore !
Soon as his feet desisted ( slack ’ ning pace ) ,
From haste , that <unk> all <unk> of act ,
My mind , that in itself before was wrapt ,
Its thoughts <unk> , as with joy restor ’ d :
And full against the steep ascent I set
My face , where highest to heav ’ n its top o ’ <unk> .
The sun , that <unk> ’ d behind , with ruddy beam
Before my form was broken ; for in me
His rays <unk> met . I turn ’ d aside
With fear of being left , when I beheld
Only before myself the ground obscur ’ d .
When thus my solace , turning him around ,
Bespake me kindly : “ Why <unk> thou ?
Believ ’ st not I am with thee , thy sure guide ?
It now is evening there , where buried lies
The body , in which I cast a shade , remov ’ d
To <unk> from <unk> ’ s wall . Nor thou
Marvel , if before me no shadow fall ,
More than that in the sky element
One ray <unk> not other . To endure
<unk> of heat and cold extreme , like <unk>
That virtue hath dispos ’ d , which how it works
<unk> not to us should be reveal ’ d . <unk>
Who hopes , our reason may that space explore ,
Which holds three persons in one substance knit .
Seek not the wherefore , race of human kind ;
Could ye have seen the whole , no need had been
For Mary to bring forth . <unk> ye
Have seen such men <unk> <unk> ;
To whose desires repose would have been giv ’ n ,
That now but serve them for eternal grief .
I speak of Plato , and the Stagyrite ,
And others many more . ” And then he bent
<unk> his forehead , and in troubled mood
Broke off his speech . Meanwhile we had arriv ’ d
Far as the mountain ’ s foot , and there the rock
<unk> of so steep ascent , that nimblest steps
To climb it had been vain . The most remote
Most wild <unk> path , in all the tract
’ Twixt <unk> and <unk> were to this
A ladder easy ’ and open of access .
“ Who knows on which hand now the steep declines ? ”
My master said and paus ’ d , “ so that he may
<unk> , who journeys without aid of wine ? ”
And while with looks directed to the ground
The meaning of the pathway he explor ’ d ,
And I gaz ’ d upward round the stony height ,
Of spirits , that toward us mov ’ d their steps ,
Yet moving seem ’ d not , they so slow approach ’ d .
I thus my guide address ’ d : “ <unk> thine eyes ,
Lo that way some , of whom thou may ’ st obtain
Counsel , if of thyself thou find ’ st it not ! ”
Straightway he look ’ d , and with free speech replied :
“ Let us tend thither : they but softly come .
And thou be firm in hope , my son belov ’ d . ”
Now was that people distant far in space
A thousand paces behind ours , as much
As at a throw the <unk> arm could fling ,
When all drew backward on the <unk> crags
Of the steep bank , and firmly stood unmov ’ d
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look .
“ O spirits perfect ! O already chosen ! ”
Virgil to them began , “ by that blest peace ,
Which , as I deem , is for you all prepar ’ d ,
Instruct us where the mountain low declines ,
So that attempt to mount it be not vain .
For who knows most , him loss of time most grieves . ”
As <unk> , that step from forth their fold , by one ,
Or <unk> , or three at once ; meanwhile the rest
Stand <unk> , bending the eye and nose
To ground , and what the foremost does , that do
The others , gath ’ ring round her , if she stops ,
<unk> and quiet , nor the cause discern ;
So saw I moving to advance the first ,
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head ,
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait .
When they before me had beheld the light
From my right side fall broken on the ground ,
So that the shadow reach ’ d the cave , they stopp ’ d
And somewhat back retir ’ d : the same did all ,
Who follow ’ d , though unweeting of the cause .
“ <unk> ’ d of you , yet freely I confess ,
This is a human body which ye see .
That the sun ’ s light is broken on the ground ,
Marvel not : but believe , that not without
Virtue deriv ’ d from Heaven , we to climb
Over this wall <unk> . ” So them bespake
My master ; and that virtuous tribe rejoin ’ d ;
“ Turn , and before you there the entrance lies , ”
Making a signal to us with bent hands .
Then of them one began . “ Whoe ’ er thou art ,
Who journey ’ st thus this way , thy visage turn ,
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen . ”
I tow ’ rds him turn ’ d , and with fix ’ d eye beheld .
<unk> , and fair , and gentle of aspect ,
He seem ’ d , but on one brow a gash was mark ’ d .
When <unk> I <unk> ’ d to have beheld
Him ever : “ Now behold ! ” he said , and show ’ d
High on his breast a wound : then smiling spake .
“ I am <unk> , grandson to the Queen
Costanza : whence I pray thee , when return ’ d ,
To my fair daughter go , the parent glad
Of <unk> and <unk> ’ s pride ;
And of the truth inform her , if of me
Aught else be told . When by two mortal blows
My frame was shatter ’ d , I betook myself
Weeping to him , who of free will <unk> .
My sins were horrible ; but so wide arms
Hath goodness <unk> , that it receives
All who turn to it . Had this text divine
Been of <unk> ’ s shepherd better scann ’ d ,
Who then by <unk> on my hunt was set ,
Yet at the bridge ’ s head my bones had lain ,
Near <unk> , by the heavy mole
<unk> ; but the rain now <unk> them ,
And the wind drives , out of the kingdom ’ s bounds ,
Far as the stream of <unk> , where , with lights
<unk> ’ d , he remov ’ d them from their bed .
Yet by their <unk> we are not so destroy ’ d ,
But that the eternal love may turn , while hope
<unk> her verdant <unk> . True it is ,
That such one as in <unk> dies
Against the holy church , though he repent ,
Must wander <unk> for all the time
In his <unk> past ; if such decree
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss ;
<unk> to my good Costanza , how
Thou hast beheld me , and beside the terms
Laid on me of that interdict ; for here
By means of those below much profit comes . ”
CANTO IV
When by <unk> of delight or pain ,
That any of our <unk> hath seiz ’ d ,
<unk> the soul collects herself , it seems
She is intent upon that power alone ,
And thus the error is <unk> ’ d which holds
The soul not singly lighted in the breast .
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen ,
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn ’ d ,
Time passes , and a man perceives it not .
For that , whereby he hearken , is one power ,
Another that , which the whole spirit <unk> ;
This is as it were bound , while that is free .
This found I true by proof , hearing that spirit
And wond ’ ring ; for full fifty steps aloft
The sun had measur ’ d unobserv ’ d of me ,
When we arriv ’ d where all with one accord
The spirits shouted , “ Here is what ye ask . ”
A larger <unk> ofttimes is stopp ’ d
With forked stake of thorn by villager ,
When the <unk> <unk> <unk> , than was the path ,
By which my guide , and I behind him close ,
<unk> solitary , when that troop
<unk> left us . On <unk> ’ s road
Who journeys , or to <unk> low descends ,
Or mounts <unk> ’ s height , must use his feet ;
But here a man had need to fly , I mean
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire ,
Conducted by his aid , who gave me hope ,
And with light <unk> ’ d to direct my way .
We through the broken rock ascended , close
Pent on each side , while underneath the ground
Ask ’ d help of hands and feet . When we arriv ’ d
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank ,
Where the plain level open ’ d I exclaim ’ d ,
“ O master ! say which way can we proceed ? ”
He answer ’ d , “ Let no step of thine recede .
Behind me gain the mountain , till to us
Some practis ’ d guide appear . ” That eminence
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point ,
And the side proudly rising , more than line
From the mid <unk> to the centre drawn .
I wearied thus began : “ <unk> belov ’ d !
Turn , and behold how I remain alone ,
If thou stay not . ” — “ My son ! ” He straight reply ’ d ,
“ Thus far put forth thy strength ; ” and to a track
Pointed , that , on this side <unk> , round
<unk> the hill . His words so spurr ’ d me on ,
That I behind him clamb ’ ring , forc ’ d myself ,
Till my feet press ’ d the circuit plain beneath .
There both together seated , turn ’ d we round
To <unk> , whence was our ascent : and oft
Many beside have with delight look ’ d back .
First on the nether shores I turn ’ d my eyes ,
Then rais ’ d them to the sun , and wond ’ ring mark ’ d
That from the left it smote us . Soon perceiv ’ d
That Poet sage now at the car of light
<unk> ’ d I stood , where ’ twixt us and the north
Its course it enter ’ d . Whence he thus to me :
“ Were <unk> ’ s offspring now in company
Of that broad mirror , that high up and low
<unk> his light beneath , thou might ’ st behold
The ruddy <unk> nearer to the bears
Wheel , if its ancient course it not forsook .
How that may be if thou would ’ st think ; within
<unk> ’ ring , <unk> <unk> with this mount
Plac ’ d on the earth , so that to both be one
<unk> , and two <unk> apart ,
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
To guide his erring chariot : thou wilt see
How of necessity by this on one
He passes , while by that on the ’ other side ,
If with clear view shine intellect <unk> . ”
“ Of truth , kind teacher ! ” I exclaim ’ d , “ so clear
Aught saw I never , as I now discern
Where seem ’ d my ken to fail , that the mid orb
Of the supernal motion ( which in terms
Of art is called the <unk> , and remains
Ever between the sun and winter ) for the cause
Thou hast assign ’ d , from hence toward the north
<unk> , when those who in the Hebrew land
Inhabit , see it tow ’ rds the <unk> part .
But if it please thee , I would gladly know ,
How far we have to journey : for the hill
<unk> higher , than this sight of mine can mount . ”
He thus to me : “ Such is this steep ascent ,
That it is ever difficult at first ,
But , more a man proceeds , less evil grows .
When pleasant it shall seem to thee , so much
That upward going shall be easy to thee .
As in a vessel to go down the tide ,
Then of this path thou wilt have reach ’ d the end .
There hope to rest thee from thy toil . No more
I answer , and thus far for certain know . ”
As he his words had spoken , near to us
A voice there <unk> : “ Yet ye first perchance
May to repose you by constraint be led . ”
At sound thereof each turn ’ d , and on the left
A huge stone we beheld , of which nor I
Nor he before was ware . Thither we drew ,
find there were some , who in the <unk> place
Behind the rock were standing , as a man
<unk> ’ <unk> might stand . Among them one ,
Who seem ’ d to me much wearied , sat him down ,
And with his arms did fold his knees about ,
Holding his face between them downward bent .
“ Sweet Sir ! ” I cry ’ d , “ behold that man , who shows
Himself more idle , than if <unk>
Were sister to him . ” Straight he turn ’ d to us ,
And , o ’ er the thigh lifting his face , observ ’ d ,
Then in these accents spake : “ Up then , proceed
Thou <unk> one . ” Straight who it was I knew ;
Nor could the pain I felt ( for want of breath
Still somewhat urg ’ d me ) hinder my approach .
And when I came to him , he scarce his head
Uplifted , saying “ Well hast thou discern ’ d ,
How from the left the sun his chariot leads . ”
His lazy acts and broken words my lips
To laughter somewhat mov ’ d ; when I began :
“ <unk> , now for thee I grieve no more .
But tell , why thou art seated upright there ?
<unk> thou escort to conduct thee hence ?
Or blame I only shine accustom ’ d ways ? ”
Then he : “ My brother , of what use to mount ,
When to my suffering would not let me pass
The bird of God , who at the portal sits ?
Behooves so long that heav ’ n first bear me round
Without its limits , as in life it bore ,
Because I to the end repentant <unk>
Delay ’ d , if prayer do not aid me first ,
That riseth up from heart which lives in grace .
What other kind avails , not heard in heaven ? ”
Before me now the Poet up the mount
Ascending , cried : “ Haste thee , for see the sun
Has touch ’ d the point meridian , and the night
Now covers with her foot <unk> ’ s shore . ”
CANTO V
Now had I left those spirits , and pursued
The steps of my <unk> , when beheld
<unk> the finger at me one exclaim ’ d :
“ See how it seems as if the light not shone
From the left hand of him beneath , and he ,
As living , seems to be led on . ” Mine eyes
I at that sound reverting , saw them gaze
Through wonder first at me , and then at me
And the light broken underneath , by turns .
“ Why are thy thoughts thus riveted ? ” my guide
Exclaim ’ d , “ that thou hast slack ’ d thy pace ? or how
<unk> it thee , what thing is whisper ’ d here ?
Come after me , and to their <unk> leave
The crowd . Be as a tower , that , firmly set ,
<unk> not its top for any blast that blows !
He , in whose bosom thought on thought <unk> out ,
Still of his aim is wide , in that the one
<unk> and wastes to nought the other ’ s strength . ”
What other could I answer save “ I come ? ”
I said it , somewhat with that colour <unk> ’ d
Which ofttimes pardon <unk> for man .
Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came ,
A little way before us , some who sang
The “ <unk> ” in responsive <unk> .
When they perceiv ’ d that through my body I
Gave way not for the rays to pass , their song
Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang ’ d ;
And two of them , in guise of messengers ,
Ran on to meet us , and inquiring ask ’ d :
“ Of your condition we would gladly learn . ”
To them my guide . “ Ye may return , and bear
Tidings to them who sent you , that his frame
Is <unk> flesh . If , as I deem , to view
His shade they paus ’ d , enough is answer ’ d them .
Him let them honour , they may prize him well . ”
Ne ’ er saw I fiery vapours with such speed
<unk> through the serene air at fall of night ,
Nor <unk> ’ s clouds athwart the setting sun ,
That upward these did not in shorter space
Return ; and , there arriving , with the rest
Wheel back on us , as with loose rein a troop .
“ Many , ” exclaim ’ d the bard , “ are these , who throng
Around us : to petition thee they come .
Go therefore on , and listen as thou go ’ st . ”
“ O spirit ! who go ’ st on to blessedness
With the same limbs , that clad thee at thy birth . ”
<unk> they came , “ a little rest thy step .
Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
Hast e ’ er beheld , that tidings of him there
Thou mayst report . Ah , wherefore go ’ st thou on ?
Ah wherefore tarriest thou not ? We all
By violence died , and to our latest hour
Were sinners , but then warn ’ d by light from heav ’ n ,
So that , repenting and <unk> , we
Did issue out of life at peace with God ,
Who with desire to see him fills our heart . ”
Then I : “ The visages of all I scan
Yet none of ye remember . But if aught ,
That I can do , may please you , gentle spirits !
Speak ; and I will perform it , by that peace ,
Which on the steps of guide so <unk>
Following from world to world intent I seek . ”
In answer he began : “ None here <unk>
Thy kindness , though not promis ’ d with an oath ;
So as the will fail not for want of power .
Whence I , who sole before the others speak ,
Entreat thee , if thou ever see that land ,
Which lies between Romagna and the realm
Of Charles , that of thy courtesy thou pray
Those who <unk> Fano , that for me
Their <unk> duly be put up ,
By which I may purge off my grievous sins .
From thence I came . But the deep passages ,
Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt ,
Upon my bosom in <unk> ’ s land
Were made , where to be more secure I thought .
The <unk> of the deed was Este ’ s prince ,
Who , more than right could warrant , with his wrath
Pursued me . Had I towards <unk> fled ,
When overta ’ en at <unk> , still
Might I have breath ’ d . But to the marsh I sped ,
And in the mire and <unk> tangled there
Fell , and beheld my life-blood float the plain . ”
Then said another : “ Ah ! so may the wish ,
That takes thee o ’ er the mountain , be fulfill ’ d ,
As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine .
Of <unk> I ; <unk> I :
Giovanna nor none else have care for me ,
Sorrowing with these I therefore go . ” I thus :
“ From <unk> ’ s field what force or chance
Drew thee , that ne ’ er thy <unk> was known ? ”
“ Oh ! ” answer ’ d he , “ at Casentino ’ s foot
A stream there courseth , nam ’ d Archiano , sprung
In Apennine above the <unk> ’ s seat .
E ’ en where its name is cancel ’ d , there came I ,
Pierc ’ d in the heart , fleeing away on foot ,
And <unk> the plain . Here sight and speech
Fail ’ d me , and <unk> with Mary ’ s name
I fell , and tenantless my flesh remain ’ d .
I will report the truth ; which thou again
Tell to the living . Me God ’ s angel took ,
Whilst he of hell exclaim ’ d : “ O thou from heav ’ n !
Say wherefore hast thou <unk> ’ d me ? Thou of him
Th ’ eternal portion bear ’ st with thee away
For one poor tear that he deprives me of .
But of the other , other rule I make . ”
“ Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
That vapour <unk> , returning into water ,
Soon as it mounts where cold <unk> it .
That evil will , which in his intellect
Still follows evil , came , and rais ’ d the wind
And <unk> mist , by virtue of the power
Given by his nature . Thence the valley , soon
As day was spent , he cover ’ d o ’ er with cloud
From <unk> to the mountain range ,
And stretch ’ d the sky above , so that the air
Impregnate chang ’ d to water . Fell the rain ,
And to the fosses came all that the land
<unk> ’ d not ; and , as <unk> streams are wont ,
To the great river with such headlong sweep
Rush ’ d , that nought stay ’ d its course . My <unk> ’ d frame
Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found ,
And dash ’ d it into Arno , from my breast
<unk> ’ ning the cross , that of myself I made
When overcome with pain . He hurl ’ d me on ,
Along the banks and bottom of his course ;
Then in his muddy spoils <unk> wrapt . ”
“ Ah ! when thou to the world shalt be return ’ d ,
And rested after thy long road , ” so spake
Next the third spirit ; “ then remember me .
I once was <unk> . Sienna gave me life ,
Maremma took it from me . That he knows ,
Who me with <unk> ’ d ring had first espous ’ d . ”
CANTO VI
When from their <unk> of <unk> men separate ,
He , who hath lost , remains in sadness fix ’ d ,
<unk> in his mind , what luckless throws
He cast : but meanwhile all the company
Go with the other ; one before him runs ,
And one behind his mantle <unk> , one
Fast by his side bids him remember him .
He stops not ; and each one , to whom his hand
Is stretch ’ d , well knows he bids him stand aside ;
And thus he from the press <unk> himself .
E ’ en such was I in that <unk> throng ;
And turning so my face around to all ,
And <unk> , I ’ scap ’ d from it with pains .
Here of Arezzo him I saw , who fell
By <unk> ’ s cruel arm ; and him beside ,
Who in his chase was swallow ’ d by the stream .
Here <unk> <unk> , with his hand
Stretch ’ d forth , <unk> ; and of Pisa he ,
Who put the good <unk> to such proof
Of <unk> . Count <unk> I beheld ;
And from its frame a soul dismiss ’ d for spite
And envy , as it said , but for no crime :
I speak of Peter de <unk> <unk> ; and here ,
While she yet lives , that Lady of <unk>
Let her beware ; lest for so false a deed
She herd with worse than these . When I was freed
From all those spirits , who pray ’ d for others ’ prayers
To hasten on their state of blessedness ;
Straight I began : “ O thou , my luminary !
It seems <unk> in thy text denied ,
That heaven ’ s supreme decree can never bend
To <unk> ; yet with this design
Do these entreat . Can then their hope be vain ,
Or is thy saying not to me reveal ’ d ? ”
He thus to me : “ Both what I write is plain ,
And these <unk> ’ d not in their hope , if well
Thy mind <unk> , that the sacred height
Of judgment doth not stoop , because love ’ s flame
In a short moment all fulfils , which he
Who <unk> here , in right should satisfy .
Besides , when I this point concluded thus ,
By praying no defect could be supplied ;
Because the pray ’ r had none access to God .
Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
Contented unless she assure thee so ,
Who betwixt truth and mind <unk> light .
I know not if thou take me right ; I mean
Beatrice . Her thou shalt behold above ,
Upon this mountain ’ s crown , fair seat of joy . ”
Then I : “ Sir ! let us mend our speed ; for now
I tire not as before ; and lo ! the hill
<unk> its shadow far . ” He answer ’ d thus :
“ Our progress with this day shall be as much
As we may now dispatch ; but otherwise
Than thou <unk> is the truth . For there
Thou canst not be , ere thou once more behold
Him back returning , who behind the steep
Is now so hidden , that as erst his beam
Thou dost not break . But lo ! a spirit there
Stands solitary , and toward us looks :
It will instruct us in the <unk> way . ”
We soon approach ’ d it . O thou Lombard spirit !
How didst thou stand , in high <unk> mood ,
Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes !
It spoke not aught , but let us onward pass ,
<unk> us as a lion on his watch .
But Virgil with entreaty mild advanc ’ d ,
<unk> it to show the best ascent .
It answer to his question none return ’ d ,
But of our country and our kind of life
<unk> . When my courteous guide began ,
“ Mantua , ” the solitary shadow quick
Rose towards us from the place in which it stood ,
And cry ’ d , “ Mantuan ! I am thy countryman
Sordello . ” Each the other then embrac ’ d .
Ah <unk> Italy ! thou <unk> of grief ,
<unk> without a pilot in loud storm ,
Lady no longer of fair <unk> ,
But <unk> impure ! this gentle spirit ,
Ev ’ n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
With such glad cheer ; while now thy living ones
In thee abide not without war ; and one
<unk> <unk> another , <unk> of those
Whom the same wall and the same moat contains ,
Seek , wretched one ! around thy <unk> wide ;
Then homeward to thy bosom turn , and mark
If any part of the sweet peace enjoy .
What <unk> it , that thy reins <unk> ’ s hand
<unk> , if thy saddle be <unk> ’ d ?
<unk> doth he now but <unk> thy shame .
Ah people ! thou obedient still shouldst live ,
And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit ,
If well thou <unk> ’ st that which God <unk> .
Look how that beast to <unk> hath <unk> ’ d
From having lost <unk> of the <unk> ,
Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand ,
O German <unk> ! who abandon ’ st her ,
That is grown savage and <unk> ,
When thou should ’ st clasp her <unk> with forked heels .
Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood !
And be it strange and manifest to all !
Such as may strike thy successor with dread !
For that thy sire and thou have suffer ’ d thus ,
Through <unk> of yonder realms detain ’ d ,
The garden of the empire to run waste .
Come see the <unk> and <unk> ,
The <unk> and <unk> ! man
Who car ’ st for nought ! those sunk in grief , and these
With dire suspicion rack ’ d . Come , cruel one !
Come and behold the ’ <unk> of the nobles ,
And mark their <unk> : and thou mayst see .
What safety <unk> can supply .
Come and behold thy Rome , who calls on thee ,
<unk> widow ! day and night with moans :
“ My Caesar , why dost thou desert my side ? ”
Come and behold what love among thy people :
And if no pity touches thee for us ,
Come and <unk> for thine own report . For me ,
If it be lawful , O Almighty Power ,
Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified !
Are thy just eyes turn ’ d elsewhere ? or is this
A <unk> in the wond ’ rous depth
Of thy sage counsel made , for some good end ,
<unk> from our reach of thought cut off ?
So are the ’ Italian <unk> all o ’ erthrong ’ d
With tyrants , and a great <unk> made
Of every <unk> <unk> villager .
My Florence ! thou mayst well remain unmov ’ d
At this <unk> , which <unk> not thee :
<unk> to thy people , who so <unk> speed .
Many have justice in their heart , that long
<unk> for counsel to direct the bow ,
Or ere it dart unto its aim : but shine
Have it on their lip ’ s edge . Many refuse
To bear the common burdens : readier thine
Answer <unk> ’ d , and cry , “ Behold I stoop ! ”
Make thyself glad , for thou hast reason now ,
Thou wealthy ! thou at peace ! thou <unk> !
<unk> best witness if I speak the truth .
Athens and <unk> , who of old
<unk> laws , for <unk> arts renown ’ d ,
Made little progress in <unk> life
Tow ’ rds thee , who <unk> such <unk> subtlety ,
That to the middle of <unk> scarce
<unk> the thread thou in <unk> <unk> ’ st .
How many times , within thy memory ,
<unk> , and laws , and <unk> , and <unk>
Have been by thee renew ’ d , and people chang ’ d !
If thou remember ’ st well and can ’ st see clear ,
Thou wilt <unk> thyself like a <unk> wretch ,
Who finds no rest upon her down , but oft
Shifting her side , short respite seeks from pain .
CANTO VII
After their courteous <unk> <unk>
Sev ’ n times exchang ’ d , Sordello backward drew
Exclaiming , “ Who are ye ? ” “ Before this mount
By spirits worthy of ascent to God
Was sought , my bones had by <unk> ’ care
Been buried . I am Virgil , for no sin
Depriv ’ d of heav ’ n , except for lack of faith . ”
So answer ’ d him in few my gentle guide .
As one , who aught before him suddenly
Beholding , whence his wonder riseth , cries
“ It is yet is not , ” wav ’ ring in belief ;
Such he appear ’ d ; then downward bent his eyes ,
And drawing near with <unk> step ,
Caught him , where of mean estate might clasp
His lord . “ Glory of Latium ! ” he exclaim ’ d ,
“ In whom our tongue its utmost power display ’ d !
<unk> of my <unk> ’ d birth-place ! what desert
Of mine , what favour rather <unk> ’ d ,
<unk> thee to me ? If I to hear that voice
Am worthy , say if from below thou com ’ st
And from what cloister ’ s pale ? ” — “ Through every orb
Of that sad region , ” he reply ’ d , “ thus far
Am I arriv ’ d , by heav ’ nly influence led
And with such aid I come . There is a place
There underneath , not made by torments sad ,
But by dun shades alone ; where mourning ’ s voice
Sounds not of anguish sharp , but breathes in sighs . ”
There I with little <unk> abide ,
Who by death ’ s fangs were bitten , ere exempt
From human taint . There I with those abide ,
Who the three holy virtues put not on ,
But understood the rest , and without blame
Follow ’ d them all . But if thou know ’ st and canst ,
Direct us , how we <unk> may arrive ,
Where Purgatory its true beginning takes . ”
He answer ’ d thus : “ We have no certain place
<unk> ’ d us : upwards I may go or round ,
Far as I can , I join thee for thy guide .
But thou beholdest now how day declines :
And upwards to proceed by night , our power
<unk> : therefore it may be well to choose
A place of pleasant sojourn . To the right
Some spirits sit apart retir ’ d . If thou
<unk> , I to these will lead thy steps :
And thou wilt know them , not without delight . ”
“ How chances this ? ” was answer ’ d ; “ who so wish ’ d
To ascend by night , would he be thence <unk> ’ d
By other , or through his own weakness fail ? ”
The good Sordello then , along the ground
<unk> his finger , spoke : “ Only this line
Thou shalt not overpass , soon as the sun
Hath disappear ’ d ; not that aught else <unk>
Thy going upwards , save the shades of night .
These with the wont of power perplex the will .
With them thou haply mightst return beneath ,
Or to and fro around the mountain ’ s side
<unk> , while day is in the horizon shut . ”
My master straight , as wond ’ ring at his speech ,
Exclaim ’ d : “ Then lead us quickly , where thou sayst ,
That , while we stay , we may enjoy delight . ”
A little space we were remov ’ d from thence ,
When I perceiv ’ d the mountain hollow ’ d out .
Ev ’ n as large <unk> hollow ’ d out on earth ,
“ That way , ” the ’ escorting spirit cried , “ we go ,
Where in a bosom the high bank <unk> :
And thou await <unk> of the day . ”
Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
Led us traverse into the ridge ’ s side ,
Where more than half the sloping edge expires .
<unk> gold , and silver thrice refin ’ d ,
And <unk> grain and <unk> , Indian wood
Of lucid <unk> serene , fresh emeralds
But newly broken , by the herbs and flowers
Plac ’ d in that fair <unk> , in color all
Had been surpass ’ d , as great <unk> less .
Nor nature only there <unk> ’ d her hues ,
But of the sweetness of a thousand <unk>
A rare and <unk> ’ d fragrance made .
“ <unk> <unk> , ” on the grass and flowers
Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
Who not beyond the valley could be seen .
“ Before the west ’ ring sun <unk> to his bed , ”
Began the Mantuan , who our steps had turn ’ d ,
“ ’ Mid those desires not that I lead ye on .
For from this eminence ye shall discern
<unk> the acts and visages of all ,
Than in the nether vale among them mix ’ d .
He , who sits high above the rest , and seems
To have neglected that he should have done ,
And to the others ’ song moves not his lip ,
The Emperor <unk> call , who might have heal ’ d
The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died ,
So that by others she revives but slowly ,
He , who with kindly visage <unk> him ,
Sway ’ d in that country , where the water springs ,
That <unk> ’ s river to the Elbe , and Elbe
Rolls to the ocean : <unk> his name :
Who in his <unk> <unk> was of more worth
Than <unk> his son , a <unk> man ,
<unk> ’ d with rank <unk> and ease .
And that one with the nose <unk> , who close
In counsel seems with him of gentle look ,
<unk> expir ’ d , with ’ ring the <unk> ’ s flower .
Look there how he doth <unk> against his breast !
The other ye behold , who for his cheek
Makes of one hand a couch , with frequent sighs .
They are the father and the <unk>
Of <unk> ’ s bane : his vicious life they know
And foul ; thence comes the grief that <unk> them thus .
“ He , so robust of limb , who measure keeps
In song , with him of feature prominent ,
With ev ’ ry virtue bore his girdle brac ’ d .
And if that stripling who <unk> him sits ,
King after him had liv ’ d , his virtue then
From vessel to like vessel had been pour ’ d ;
Which may not of the other heirs be said .
By <unk> and Frederick his realms are held ;
<unk> the better heritage <unk> .
Rarely into the branches of the tree
Doth human worth mount up ; and so ordains
He who <unk> it , that as his free gift
It may be call ’ d . To Charles my words apply
No less than to his brother in the song ;
Which <unk> and Provence now with grief confess .
So much that plant <unk> from its seed ,
As more than Beatrice and <unk>
Costanza still boasts of her <unk> spouse .
“ Behold the king of simple life and plain ,
<unk> of <unk> , <unk> there alone :
He through his branches better issue spreads .
“ That one , who on the ground beneath the rest
<unk> lowest , yet his gaze directs aloft ,
Us <unk> , that <unk> Marquis , for whose cause
The deed of <unk> and his war
Makes <unk> and <unk> weep . ”
CANTO VIII
Now was the hour that <unk> fond desire
In men at sea , and <unk> their thoughtful heart ,
Who in the morn have bid sweet friends <unk> ,
And pilgrim newly on his road with love
<unk> , if he hear the <unk> <unk> from far ,
That seems to mourn for the expiring day :
When I , no longer taking heed to hear
Began , with wonder , from those spirits to mark
One risen from its seat , which with its hand
<unk> implor ’ d . Both palms it join ’ d and rais ’ d ,
<unk> its steadfast gaze towards the east ,
As <unk> God , “ I care for naught beside . ”
“ <unk> <unk> <unk> , ” so <unk> then
Came from its lip , and in so soft a strain ,
That all my sense in <unk> was lost .
And the rest after , softly and devout ,
Follow ’ d through all the hymn , with upward gaze
Directed to the bright supernal wheels .
Here , reader ! for the truth makes thine eyes keen :
For of so subtle texture is this veil ,
That thou with ease mayst pass it through <unk> ’ d .
I saw that gentle band <unk> next
Look up , as if in <unk> held ,
<unk> and in lowly guise ; and from on high
I saw forth issuing descend beneath
Two angels with two <unk> ’ d <unk> ,
Broken and mutilated at their points .
Green as the tender leaves but newly born ,
Their vesture was , the which by wings as green
<unk> , they drew behind them , fann ’ d in air .
A little over us one took his stand ,
The other lighted on the ’ <unk> hill ,
So that the troop were in the midst contain ’ d .
Well I descried the whiteness on their heads ;
But in their visages the dazzled eye
Was lost , as faculty that by too much
Is overpower ’ d . “ From Mary ’ s bosom both
Are come , ” exclaim ’ d Sordello , “ as a guard
Over the vale , <unk> him , who hither tends ,
The serpent . ” Whence , not knowing by which path
He came , I turn ’ d me round , and closely press ’ d ,
All frozen , to my leader ’ s trusted side .
Sordello paus ’ d not : “ To the valley now
( For it is time ) let us descend ; and hold
<unk> with those great shadows : haply much
Their sight may please ye . ” Only three steps down
Methinks I measur ’ d , ere I was beneath ,
And noted one who look ’ d as with desire
To know me . Time was now that air arrow dim ;
Yet not so dim , that ’ twixt his eyes and mine
It clear ’ d not up what was conceal ’ d before .
<unk> tow ’ rds each other we advanc ’ d .
Nino , thou courteous judge ! what joy I felt ,
When I perceiv ’ d thou wert not with the bad !
No salutation kind on either part
Was left <unk> . He then inquir ’ d : “ How long
Since thou arrived ’ st at the mountain ’ s foot ,
Over the distant waves ? ” — “ O ! ” answer ’ d I ,
“ Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came ,
And still in my first life , thus journeying on ,
The other strive to gain . ” Soon as they heard
My words , he and Sordello backward drew ,
As suddenly amaz ’ d . To Virgil one ,
The other to a spirit turn ’ d , who near
Was seated , crying : “ Conrad ! up with speed :
Come , see what of his grace high God hath will ’ d . ”
Then turning round to me : “ By that rare mark
Of honour which thou ow ’ st to him , who hides
So deeply his first cause , it hath no ford ,
When thou shalt be beyond the vast of waves .
Tell my Giovanna , that for me she call
There , where reply to innocence is made .
Her mother , I believe , loves me no more ;
Since she has chang ’ d the white and <unk> folds ,
Which she is doom ’ d once more with grief to wish .
By her it easily may be perceiv ’ d ,
How long in women lasts the flame of love ,
If sight and touch do not <unk> it oft .
For her so fair a <unk> will not make
The <unk> which calls Milan to the field ,
As had been made by shrill Gallura ’ s bird . ”
He spoke , and in his visage took the stamp
Of that right seal , which with due <unk>
<unk> in the bosom . My <unk> eyes
Meanwhile to heav ’ n had travel ’ d , even there
Where the bright stars are slowest , as a wheel
Nearest the <unk> ; when my guide inquir ’ d :
“ What there aloft , my son , has caught thy gaze ? ”
I answer ’ d : “ The three <unk> , with which here
The pole is all on fire . ” He then to me :
“ The four <unk> stars , thou saw ’ st this morn
Are there beneath , and these ris ’ n in their stead . ”
While yet he spoke . Sordello to himself
Drew him , and cry ’ d : “ Lo there our enemy ! ”
And with his hand pointed that way to look .
Along the side , where <unk> none arose
Around the little vale , a serpent lay ,
Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food .
Between the grass and flowers , the evil snake
Came on , reverting oft his lifted head ;
And , as a beast that <unk> its polish ’ d coat ,
<unk> his hack . I saw not , nor can tell ,
How those celestial <unk> from their seat
Mov ’ d , but in motion each one well descried ,
<unk> the air cut by their verdant plumes .
The serpent fled ; and to their <unk> back
The angels up return ’ d with equal flight .
The Spirit ( who to Nino , when he call ’ d ,
Had come ) , from <unk> me with fixed ken ,
Through all that conflict , loosen ’ d not his sight .
“ So may the lamp , which leads thee up on high ,
<unk> , in thy destin ’ d lot , of wax so much ,
As may suffice thee to the enamel ’ s height . ”
It thus began : “ If any certain news
Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
Thou know ’ st , tell me , who once was mighty there
They call ’ d me Conrad <unk> , not
That old one , but from him I sprang . The love
I bore my people is now here refin ’ d . ”
“ In your <unk> , ” I answer ’ d , “ ne ’ er was I.
But through all <unk> where do those men dwell ,
To whom their glory is not manifest ?
The fame , that honours your illustrious house ,
<unk> the nobles and <unk> the land ;
So that he knows it who was never there .
I swear to you , so may my upward route
<unk> ! your honour ’ d nation not <unk>
The <unk> of her <unk> and her sword .
Nature and use give her such privilege ,
That while the world is twisted from his course
By a bad head , she only walks aright ,
And has the evil way in scorn . ” He then :
“ Now pass thee on : sev ’ n times the <unk> sun
<unk> not the couch , which with four feet
The forked <unk> covers , ere that kind
Opinion shall be <unk> ’ d into thy brain
With <unk> nails than other ’ s speech can drive ,
If the sure course of judgment be not stay ’ d . ”
CANTO IX
Now the fair consort of <unk> old ,
<unk> from her <unk> ’ s beloved arms ,
Look ’ d <unk> o ’ er the eastern cliff : her brow ,
<unk> with <unk> , glitter ’ d , set in sign
Of that chill animal , who with his train
Smites fearful <unk> : and where then we were ,
Two steps of her ascent the night had past ,
And now the third was closing up its wing ,
When I , who had so much of Adam with me ,
<unk> down upon the grass , o ’ ercome with sleep ,
There where all five were seated . In that hour ,
When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay ,
<unk> ’ ring haply ancient grief , <unk> ,
And with our minds more wand ’ rers from the flesh ,
And less by thought restrain ’ d are , as ’ t were , full
Of holy <unk> in their dreams ,
Then in a vision did I seem to view
A <unk> ’ d eagle in the sky ,
With open wings , and hov ’ ring for descent ,
And I was in that place , methought , from whence
Young <unk> , from his associates ’ reft ,
Was snatch ’ d aloft to the high <unk> .
“ Perhaps , ” thought I within me , “ here alone
He strikes his <unk> , and elsewhere <unk>
To <unk> upon the prey . ” Therewith , it seem ’ d ,
A little wheeling in his airy <unk>
<unk> as the lightning rush ’ d he down ,
And snatch ’ d me upward even to the fire .
There both , I thought , the eagle and myself
Did burn ; and so intense th ’ imagin ’ d flames ,
That needs my sleep was broken off . As erst
Achilles shook himself , and round him roll ’ d
His waken ’ d <unk> wond ’ ring where he was ,
Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
To <unk> , with him sleeping in her arms ;
E ’ en thus I shook me , soon as from my face
The slumber parted , turning deadly pale ,
Like one <unk> with dread . <unk> at my side
My comfort stood : and the bright sun was now
More than two hours aloft : and to the sea
My looks were turn ’ d . “ Fear not , ” my master cried ,
“ Assur ’ d we are at happy point . Thy strength
<unk> not , but rise <unk> . Thou art come
To Purgatory now . Lo ! there the cliff
That circling bounds it ! Lo ! the entrance there ,
Where it doth seem disparted ! Ere the dawn
<unk> ’ d the daylight , when thy wearied soul
<unk> in thee , o ’ er the <unk> vale beneath
A lady came , and thus bespake me : I
Am Lucia . Suffer me to take this man ,
Who slumbers . <unk> so his way shall speed . ”
Sordello and the other gentle shapes
<unk> , she bare thee up : and , as day shone ,
This summit reach ’ d : and I pursued her steps .
Here did she place thee . First her lovely eyes
That open entrance show ’ d me ; then at once
She vanish ’ d with thy sleep . ” Like one , whose doubts
Are chas ’ d by certainty , and terror turn ’ d
To comfort on <unk> of the truth ,
Such was the change in me : and as my guide
<unk> me fearless , up along the cliff
He mov ’ d , and I behind him , towards the height .
Reader ! thou <unk> how my theme doth rise ,
Nor wonder therefore , if more <unk>
I prop the structure ! Nearer now we drew ,
Arriv ’ d ’ whence in that part , where first a <unk>
As of a wall appear ’ d , I could descry
A portal , and three steps beneath , that led
For <unk> there , of different colour each ,
And one who watch ’ d , but spake not yet a word .
As more and more mine eye did stretch its view ,
I mark ’ d him seated on the highest step ,
In visage such , as past my power to bear .
<unk> ’ d in his hand a naked sword , <unk> ’ d back
The rays so toward me , that I oft in vain
My sight directed . “ Speak from whence ye stand : ”
He cried : “ What would ye ? Where is your escort ?
Take heed your coming upward harm ye not . ”
“ A heavenly dame , not <unk> of these things , ”
Replied the ’ instructor , “ told us , even now ,
‘ Pass that way : here the gate is . ” — “ And may she
<unk> <unk> your ascent , ” resum ’ d
The courteous keeper of the gate : “ Come then
Before our steps . ” We straightway thither came .
The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
And polish ’ d , that therein my mirror ’ d form
Distinct I saw . The next of hue more dark
Than sablest grain , a rough and <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> ’ d <unk> and across . The third , that lay
<unk> above , seem ’ d <unk> , that <unk> ’ d
<unk> as the life-blood <unk> from a vein .
On this God ’ s angel either foot sustain ’ d ,
Upon the threshold seated , which appear ’ d
A rock of <unk> . Up the trinal steps
My leader <unk> drew me . “ Ask , ” said he ,
“ With humble heart , that he <unk> the bolt . ”
<unk> at his holy feet devolv ’ d
I cast me , praying him for pity ’ s sake
That he would open to me : but first fell
Thrice on my bosom prostrate . Seven times
The letter , that <unk> the inward stain ,
He on my forehead with the <unk> point
Of his drawn sword inscrib ’ d . And “ Look , ” he cried ,
“ When enter ’ d , that thou wash these scars away . ”
<unk> , or earth ta ’ en dry out of the ground ,
Were of one colour with the robe he wore .
From underneath that <unk> forth he drew
Two keys of metal twain : the one was gold ,
Its fellow silver . With the <unk> first ,
And next the <unk> ’ d , he so ply ’ d the gate ,
As to content me well . “ <unk> one
<unk> of these , that in the <unk> straight
It turn not , to this <unk> then expect
<unk> in vain . ” Such were the words he spake .
“ One is more precious : but the other needs
<unk> and <unk> , large share of each ,
Ere its good task to <unk> the knot
Be <unk> perform ’ d . From Peter these
I hold , of him instructed , that I err
Rather in opening than in keeping fast ;
So but the <unk> at my feet implore . ”
Then of that hallow ’ d gate he thrust the door ,
Exclaiming , “ Enter , but this warning hear :
He forth again departs who looks behind . ”
As in the <unk> of that sacred ward
The <unk> turn ’ d , <unk> metal strong ,
<unk> was the <unk> ; nor so <unk>
<unk> ’ d the <unk> , when by force bereft
Of good <unk> , thenceforth from his loss
To leanness doom ’ d . <unk> I turn ’ d ,
List ’ ning the thunder , that first issued forth ;
And “ We praise thee , O God , ” methought I heard
In accents blended with sweet melody .
The strains came o ’ er mine ear , e ’ en as the sound
Of <unk> voices , that in solemn chant
With organ <unk> , and , now high and clear ,
Come swelling , now float indistinct away .
CANTO X
When we had passed the threshold of the gate
( Which the soul ’ s ill affection doth disuse ,
Making the crooked seem the straighter path ) ,
I heard its closing sound . Had mine eyes turn ’ d ,
For that offence what plea might have avail ’ d ?
We mounted up the <unk> rock , that wound
On either side <unk> , as the wave
<unk> and advances . “ Here some little art
Behooves us , ” said my leader , “ that our steps
Observe the varying flexure of the path . ”
Thus we so slowly sped , that with cleft orb
The moon once more o ’ <unk> her wat ’ ry couch ,
Ere we that strait have <unk> . But when free
We came and open , where the mount above
One solid mass retires , I spent , with toil ,
And both , uncertain of the way , we stood ,
Upon a plain more <unk> , than the <unk>
That traverse desert wilds . From whence the brink
<unk> upon <unk> , to foot
Of the steep bank , that rises still , the space
Had measur ’ d thrice the stature of a man :
And , distant as mine eye could wing its flight ,
To leftward now and now to right dispatch ’ d ,
That cornice equal in <unk> appear ’ d .
Not yet our feet had on that summit mov ’ d ,
When I discover ’ d that the bank around ,
Whose proud <unk> all ascent denied ,
Was marble white , and so <unk> wrought
With <unk> <unk> , that not there alone
Had <unk> , but e ’ en nature ’ s self
Been <unk> ’ d . The angel who came down to earth
With tidings of the peace so many years
<unk> for in vain , that op ’ d the heavenly gates
From their long interdict before us seem ’ d ,
In a sweet act , so sculptur ’ d to the life ,
He look ’ d no silent image . One had sworn
He had said , “ <unk> ! ” for she was imag ’ d there ,
By whom the key did open to God ’ s love ,
And in her act as sensibly impress
That word , “ Behold the handmaid of the Lord , ”
As figure seal ’ d on wax . “ Fix not thy mind
On one place only , ” said the guide belov ’ d ,
Who had me near him on that part where lies
The heart of man . My sight forthwith I turn ’ d
And mark ’ d , behind the virgin mother ’ s form ,
Upon that side , where he , that mov ’ d me , stood ,
Another <unk> <unk> on the rock .
I passed athwart the bard , and drew me near ,
That it might stand more aptly for my view .
There in the self-same marble were <unk> ’ d
The <unk> and <unk> , drawing the sacred <unk> ,
That from <unk> office <unk> mankind .
Before it came much people ; and the whole
Parted in seven <unk> . One sense cried , “ <unk> , ”
Another , “ <unk> , they sing . ” Like doubt arose
Betwixt the eye and smell , from the curl ’ d <unk>
Of <unk> breathing up the <unk> toil .
<unk> the blest vessel , onward came
With light dance <unk> , girt in humble guise ,
Sweet Israel ’ s <unk> : in that hap he seem ’ d
Less and yet more than kingly . <unk> ,
At a great <unk> , from the <unk> forth
Look ’ d Michol , like a lady full of scorn
And sorrow . To behold the <unk> next ,
Which at the hack of Michol <unk> shone ,
I mov ’ d me . There was <unk> on the rock
The ’ exalted glory of the Roman prince ,
Whose mighty worth mov ’ d <unk> to <unk>
His mighty conquest , <unk> th ’ Emperor .
A widow at his bridle stood , <unk> ’ d
In tears and mourning . Round about them troop ’ d
Full throng of knights , and <unk> in gold
The <unk> <unk> , struggling with the wind .
The wretch appear ’ d amid all these to say :
“ Grant vengeance , sire ! for , woe <unk> this heart
My son is murder ’ d . ” He replying seem ’ d ;
“ Wait now till I return . ” And she , as one
Made hasty by her grief ; “ O sire , if thou
Dost not return ? ” — “ Where I am , who then is ,
May right thee . ” — “ What to thee is other ’ s good ,
If thou <unk> thy own ? ” — “ Now comfort thee , ”
At length he answers . “ It <unk> well
My duty be perform ’ d , ere I move hence :
So justice wills ; and pity bids me stay . ”
He , whose ken nothing new surveys , produc ’ d
That visible speaking , new to us and strange
The like not found on earth . <unk> I gaz ’ d
Upon those <unk> of meek <unk> ,
<unk> yet more precious for their <unk> ’ s sake ,
When “ Lo , ” the poet whisper ’ d , “ where this way
( But slack their pace ) , a multitude advance .
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on . ”
Mine eyes , though bent on view of <unk> sights
Their lov ’ d allurement , were not slow to turn .
Reader ! I would not that amaz ’ d thou miss
Of thy good purpose , hearing how just God
Decrees our <unk> be cancel ’ d . <unk> not
The form of suff ’ ring . Think on what succeeds ,
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
It cannot pass . “ Instructor , ” I began ,
“ What I see hither <unk> , bears no trace
Of human semblance , nor of aught beside
That my foil ’ d sight can guess . ” He answering thus :
“ So <unk> ’ d to earth , beneath their heavy teems
Of torment stoop they , that mine eye at first
<unk> as thine . But look <unk> thither ,
An <unk> with thy lab ’ ring view ,
What underneath those stones <unk> : now ,
E ’ en now , mayst thou discern the pangs of each . ”
Christians and proud ! O poor and wretched ones !
That feeble in the mind ’ s eye , lean your trust
Upon <unk> <unk> ! Know ye not
That we are worms , yet made at last to form
The winged <unk> , imp ’ d with angel plumes
That to heaven ’ s justice <unk> soars ?
Why <unk> ye up aloft your <unk> ’ d souls ?
<unk> then and shapeless ye remain ,
Like the <unk> <unk> of a worm !
As , to support <unk> floor or roof ,
For <unk> is a figure sometimes seen ,
That <unk> up its knees unto its breast ,
With the feign ’ d posture <unk> <unk> <unk> ’ d
In the <unk> ’ s fancy ; so I saw
These fashion ’ d , when I noted well their guise .
Each , as his back was laden , came indeed
Or more or less <unk> ; but it appear ’ d
As he , who show ’ d most patience in his look ,
Wailing exclaim ’ d : “ I can endure no more . ”
CANTO XI
“ O thou Almighty Father , who dost make
The heavens thy dwelling , not in bounds <unk> ’ d ,
But that with love intenser there thou view ’ st
Thy primal effluence , hallow ’ d be thy name :
<unk> each created being to <unk>
Thy might , for worthy <unk> thanks and praise
Is thy blest Spirit . May thy kingdom ’ s peace
Come unto us ; for we , unless it come ,
With all our striving thither tend in vain .
As of their will the angels unto thee
<unk> meet sacrifice , circling thy throne
With loud <unk> , so of theirs be done
By saintly men on earth . Grant us this day
Our <unk> <unk> , without which he roams
Through this rough desert <unk> , who most
<unk> to advance his steps . As we to each
<unk> the evil done us , pardon thou
Benign , and of our merit take no count .
’ Gainst the old <unk> prove thou not
Our virtue easily <unk> ’ d ; but free
From his <unk> and <unk> his wiles .
This last petition , dearest Lord ! is made
Not for ourselves , since that were <unk> now ,
But for their sakes who after us remain . ”
Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring ,
Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
We sometimes feel in dreams , all , sore beset ,
But with <unk> anguish , wearied all ,
Round the first circuit , <unk> as they go ,
The world ’ s gross darkness off : In our <unk>
If there vows still be offer ’ d , what can here
For them be vow ’ d and done by such , whose wills
Have root of goodness in them ? Well <unk>
That we should help them wash away the stains
They carried hence , that so made pure and light ,
They may spring upward to the <unk> spheres .
“ Ah ! so may <unk> ’ d justice rid
Your burdens speedily , that ye have power
To stretch your wing , which e ’ en to your desire
Shall lift you , as ye show us on which hand
Toward the ladder leads the <unk> way .
And if there be more passages than one ,
Instruct us of that easiest to ascend ;
For this man who comes with me , and bears yet
The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him ,
<unk> his better will but slowly mounts . ”
From whom the answer came unto these words ,
Which my guide spake , appear ’ d not ; but ’ twas said .
“ Along the bank to rightward come with us ,
And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
Of living man to climb : and were it not
That I am hinder ’ d by the rock , wherewith
This <unk> neck is <unk> ’ d , whence needs I stoop
My visage to the ground , him , who yet lives ,
Whose name thou speak ’ st not him I fain would view .
To mark if e ’ er I knew him ? and to crave
His pity for the fardel that I bear .
I was of <unk> , of a Tuscan horn
A mighty one : <unk> ’ s name
My sire ’ s , I know not if ye e ’ er have heard .
My old blood and <unk> ’ <unk> deeds
Made me so haughty , that I clean <unk>
The common mother , and to such excess ,
<unk> ’ d in my scorn of all men , that I fell ,
Fell therefore ; by what fate Sienna ’ s sons ,
Each child in <unk> , can tell .
I am <unk> ; not me only pride
Hath injur ’ d , but my kindred all <unk> ’ d
In mischief with her . Here my lot ordains
Under this weight to groan , till I <unk>
God ’ s angry justice , since I did it not
Amongst the living , here amongst the dead . ”
List ’ ning I bent my visage down : and one
( Not he who spake ) twisted beneath the weight
That urg ’ d him , saw me , knew me straight , and call ’ d ,
Holding his eyes With difficulty fix ’ d
Intent upon me , stooping as I went
<unk> of their way . “ O ! ” I exclaim ’ d ,
“ Art thou not <unk> , art not thou
<unk> ’ s glory , glory of that art
Which they of Paris call the <unk> ’ s skill ? ”
“ Brother ! ” said he , “ with <unk> that <unk> smile ,
<unk> <unk> ’ s pencil lines the leaves .
His all the honour now ; mine borrow ’ d light .
In truth I had not been thus courteous to him ,
The whilst I liv ’ d , through eagerness of zeal
For that <unk> my heart was bent on .
Here of such pride the <unk> is paid .
Nor were I even here ; if , able still
To sin , I had not turn ’ d me unto God .
O powers of man ! how vain your glory , <unk> ’ d
E ’ en in its height of verdure , if an age
Less bright <unk> not ! <unk> thought
To lord it over <unk> ’ s field ; and now
The cry is <unk> ’ s , and his name <unk> ’ d .
Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch ’ d
The letter ’ d prize : and he perhaps is born ,
Who shall drive either from their nest . The noise
Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind ,
That blows from divers points , and <unk> its name
Shifting the point it blows from . Shalt thou more
<unk> in the mouths of mankind , if thy flesh
Part shrivel ’ d from thee , than if thou hadst died ,
Before the <unk> and the <unk> were left ,
Or ere some thousand years have passed ? and that
Is , to eternity compar ’ d , a space ,
<unk> than is the twinkling of an eye
To the heaven ’ s slowest orb . He there who treads
So leisurely before me , far and wide
Through Tuscany resounded once ; and now
Is in Sienna scarce with <unk> nam ’ d :
There was he sov ’ reign , when <unk> caught
The <unk> ’ ning rage of Florence , in that day
<unk> as she now is loathsome . Your renown
Is as the herb , whose hue doth come and go ,
And his might <unk> it , by whom it sprang
<unk> from the lap of earth . ” I thus to him :
“ True are thy <unk> : to my heart they breathe
The kindly spirit of <unk> , and allay
What <unk> <unk> there . But who is he
Of whom thou spak ’ st but now ? ” — “ This , ” he replied ,
“ Is <unk> . He is here , because
He reach ’ d , with grasp <unk> , at the sway
Of all Sienna . Thus he still hath gone ,
Thus <unk> <unk> , since he died .
Such is th ’ <unk> render ’ d back of him ,
Who , beyond measure , dar ’ d on earth . ” I then :
“ If soul that to the verge of life delays
<unk> , linger in that lower space ,
Nor hither mount , unless good prayers <unk> ,
How chanc ’ d admittance was vouchsaf ’ d to him ? ”
“ When at his glory ’ s topmost height , ” said he ,
“ <unk> of dignity all cast aside ,
Freely He fix ’ d him on Sienna ’ s plain ,
A <unk> to <unk> his suff ’ ring friend ,
Who languish ’ d in the prison-house of Charles ,
Nor for his sake refus ’ d through every vein
To tremble . More I will not say ; and dark ,
I know , my words are , but thy neighbours soon
Shall help thee to a comment on the text .
This is the work , that from these limits freed him . ”
CANTO XII
With equal pace as oxen in the <unk> ,
I with that laden spirit journey ’ d on
Long as the mild instructor suffer ’ d me ;
But when he bade me quit him , and proceed
( For “ here , ” said he , “ behooves with sail and oars
Each man , as best he may , push on his bark ” ) ,
Upright , as one dispos ’ d for speed , I rais ’ d
My body , still in thought submissive bow ’ d .
I now my leader ’ s track not loth pursued ;
And each had shown how light we far ’ d along
When thus he warn ’ d me : “ Bend thine eyesight down :
For thou to ease the way shall find it good
To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet . ”
As in <unk> of the buried , drawn
Upon <unk> tombs , the sculptur ’ d form
Of what was once , appears ( at sight whereof
Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak ’ d ,
Whose sacred <unk> the piteous only feel ) ,
So saw I there , but with more curious skill
Of <unk> o ’ <unk> , whate ’ er of space
From forth the mountain stretches . On one part
Him I beheld , above all creatures erst
Created noblest , light ’ ning fall from heaven :
On th ’ other side with bolt celestial pierc ’ d
Briareus : cumb ’ ring earth he lay through <unk>
Of mortal <unk> . The <unk> god
With Mars , I saw , and <unk> , round their sire ,
<unk> ’ d still , and gazing on the giant ’ s limbs
<unk> o ’ er th ’ <unk> field . Nimrod I saw :
At foot of the <unk> work he stood ,
As if <unk> ’ d , looking on the crowd
<unk> in his proud attempt on <unk> ’ s plain .
O <unk> ! in what a trance of woe
Thee I beheld , upon that <unk> drawn ,
Sev ’ n sons on either side thee slain ! O <unk> !
How ghastly didst thou look ! on thine own sword
<unk> in <unk> , from that hour
Ne ’ er visited with rain from heav ’ n or dew !
O fond Arachne ! thee I also saw
<unk> <unk> now in anguish <unk> up
Th ’ <unk> ’ d web thou <unk> ’ st to thy bane !
O <unk> ! here thy shape doth seem
<unk> no more <unk> ! but <unk>
With none to chase him in his chariot whirl ’ d .
Was shown beside upon the solid floor
How dear Alcmaeon forc ’ d his mother rate
That ornament in evil hour <unk> ’ d :
How in the temple on <unk> fell
His sons , and how a corpse they left him there .
Was shown the <unk> and cruel <unk> made
By <unk> on <unk> , when she cried :
“ Blood thou didst thirst for , take thy fill of blood ! ”
Was shown how <unk> in the <unk> fled
Th ’ <unk> , <unk> slain , and e ’ en
The <unk> of the <unk> . Troy I mark ’ d
In ashes and in <unk> . Oh ! how fall ’ n ,
How abject , <unk> , was thy semblance there !
What master of the pencil or the style
Had trac ’ d the shades and lines , that might have made
The <unk> workman wonder ? <unk> the dead ,
The living seem ’ d alive ; with clearer view
His eye beheld not who beheld the truth ,
Than mine what I did tread on , while I went
Low bending . Now swell out ; and with <unk> necks
Pass on , ye sons of Eve ! veil not your looks ,
Lest they descry the evil of your path !
I noted not ( so busied was my thought )
How much we now had circled of the mount ,
And of his course yet more the sun had spent ,
When he , who with still <unk> caution went ,
Admonish ’ d : “ Raise thou up thy head : for know
Time is not now for slow suspense . Behold
That way an angel hasting towards us ! Lo
Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
From service on the day . <unk> thou in look
And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe ,
That gladly he may forward us aloft .
Consider that this day ne ’ er <unk> again . ”
Time ’ s loss he had so often warn ’ d me ’ gainst ,
I could not miss the <unk> at which he aim ’ d .
The goodly shape approach ’ d us , snowy white
In vesture , and with visage <unk> streams
Of tremulous lustre like the matin star .
His arms he open ’ d , then his wings ; and spake :
“ Onward : the steps , behold ! are near ; and now
Th ’ ascent is without difficulty gain ’ d . ”
A <unk> few are they , who when they hear
Such tidings , hasten . O ye race of men
Though born to <unk> , why suffer ye a wind
So slight to <unk> ye ? He led us on
Where the rock parted ; here against my front
Did beat his wings , then promis ’ d I should <unk>
In safety on my way . As to ascend
That steep , upon whose brow the <unk> stands
( O ’ er <unk> , looking <unk> down
On the <unk> city , ) up the right
Th ’ impetuous rise is broken by the steps
<unk> ’ d in that old and simple age , when still
The <unk> and <unk> rested safe ;
Thus is th ’ <unk> <unk> ’ d , which here
<unk> from the other circuit falls :
But on each hand the <unk> cliff presses close .
As ent ’ ring there we turn ’ d , voices , in strain
<unk> , sang : “ Blessed are the poor
In spirit . ” Ah how far unlike to these
The straits of hell ; here songs to usher us ,
There shrieks of woe ! We climb the holy stairs :
And lighter to myself by far I seem ’ d
Than on the plain before , whence thus I spake :
“ Say , master , of what heavy thing have I
Been lighten ’ d , that scarce aught the sense of toil
<unk> me journeying ? ” He in few replied :
“ When sin ’ s broad characters , that yet remain
Upon thy temples , though well nigh <unk> ’ d ,
Shall be , as one is , all clean <unk> out ,
Then shall thy feet by <unk> of will
Be so o ’ ercome , they not alone shall feel
No sense of labour , but delight much more
Shall wait them urg ’ d along their upward way . ”
Then like to one , upon whose head is plac ’ d
Somewhat he deems not of but from the <unk>
Of others as they pass him by ; his hand
<unk> therefore help to ’ assure him , <unk> , finds ,
And well <unk> such office as the eye
<unk> power to execute : so stretching forth
The fingers of my right hand , did I find
<unk> only of the <unk> , which his sword
Who bare the keys had trac ’ d upon my brow .
The leader , as he mark ’ d mine action , smil ’ d .
CANTO XIII
We reach ’ d the summit of the scale , and stood
Upon the second <unk> of that mount
Which healeth him who climbs . A cornice there ,
Like to the former , <unk> round the hill ;
Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends .
<unk> nor image there is seen ; all smooth
The rampart and the path , <unk> nought
But the rock ’ s <unk> hue . “ If here we wait
For some to question , ” said the bard , “ I fear
Our choice may haply meet too long delay . ”
Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
He <unk> ’ d , made his right the <unk> point
From whence to move , and turn ’ d the left aside .
“ O pleasant light , my confidence and hope ,
Conduct us thou , ” he cried , “ on this new way ,
Where now I venture , <unk> to the bourn
We seek . The <unk> world to thee
<unk> warmth and lustre . If no other cause
<unk> , thy beams should ever be our guide . ”
Far , as is measur ’ d for a <unk> on earth ,
In brief space had we journey ’ d ; such prompt will
Impell ’ d ; and towards us <unk> , now were heard
Spirits invisible , who <unk>
Unto love ’ s table bade the welcome <unk> .
The voice , that first ? flew by , call ’ d forth aloud ,
“ They have no wine ; ” so on behind us past ,
Those sounds <unk> , nor yet lost
In the faint distance , when another came
Crying , “ I am <unk> , ” and alike
<unk> ’ d its fleet way . “ Oh father ! ” I exclaim ’ d ,
“ What tongues are these ? ” and as I question ’ d , lo !
A third exclaiming , “ Love ye those have wrong ’ d you . ”
“ This circuit , ” said my teacher , “ <unk> the scourge
For envy , and the cords are therefore drawn
By charity ’ s <unk> hand . The curb
Is of a <unk> sound , as thou shalt hear
( If I deem rightly ) , ere thou reach the pass ,
Where pardon sets them free . But fix thine eyes
Intently through the air , and thou shalt see
A multitude before thee seated , each
Along the shelving <unk> . ” Then more than erst
I op ’ d my eyes , before me view ’ d , and saw
<unk> with garments dark as was the rock ;
And when we pass ’ d a little forth , I heard
A crying , “ Blessed Mary ! pray for us ,
Michael and Peter ! all ye saintly host ! ”
I do not think there walks on earth this day
Man so remorseless , that he hath not yearn ’ d
With pity at the sight that next I saw .
Mine eyes a load of sorrow <unk> , when now
I stood so near them , that their semblances
Came clearly to my view . Of <unk> vile
Their cov ’ ring seem ’ d ; and on his shoulder one
Did stay another , leaning , and all lean ’ d
Against the cliff . E ’ en thus the blind and poor ,
Near the <unk> , to crave an <unk> ,
Stand , each his head upon his fellow ’ s sunk ,
So most to stir compassion , not by sound
Of words alone , but that , which moves not less ,
The sight of mis ’ ry . And as never beam
Of noonday <unk> the <unk> man ,
E ’ en so was heav ’ n a <unk> unto these
Of his fair light ; for , through the orbs of all ,
A thread of <unk> , <unk> , knits them up ,
As for the <unk> of a <unk> hawk .
It were a wrong , methought , to pass and look
On others , yet myself the while <unk> .
To my sage counsel therefore did I turn .
He knew the meaning of the mute appeal ,
Nor waited for my questioning , but said :
“ Speak ; and be brief , be subtle in thy words . ”
On that part of the cornice , whence no rim
<unk> its steep fall , did Virgil come ;
On the ’ other side me were the spirits , their cheeks
<unk> devout with <unk> tears ,
That through the dread <unk> forc ’ d a way .
I turn ’ d me to them , and “ O shades ! ” said I ,
“ Assur ’ d that to your eyes unveil ’ d shall shine
The lofty light , sole object of your wish ,
So may heaven ’ s grace clear whatsoe ’ er of foam
<unk> turbid on the conscience , that thenceforth
The stream of mind roll limpid from its source ,
As ye declare ( for so shall ye impart
A boon I dearly prize ) if any soul
Of Latium dwell among ye ; and perchance
That soul may profit , if I learn so much . ”
“ My brother , we are each one citizens
Of one true city . Any thou wouldst say ,
Who lived a <unk> in Italia ’ s land . ”
So heard I answering , as appeal ’ d , a voice
That onward came some space from whence I stood .
A spirit I noted , in whose look was mark ’ d
Expectance . Ask ye how ? The chin was rais ’ d
As in one reft of sight . “ Spirit , ” said I ,
“ Who for thy rise are <unk> ( if thou be
That which didst answer to me , ) or by place
Or name , disclose thyself , that I may know thee . ”
“ I was , ” it answer ’ d , “ of Sienna : here
I cleanse away with these the evil life ,
<unk> with tears that He , who is ,
Vouchsafe him to us . Though <unk> nam ’ d
In <unk> I <unk> ’ d not , <unk> far
Of others ’ <unk> , than of the good befell me .
That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not ,
Hear , if my folly were not as I speak it .
When now my years slop ’ d <unk> down the arch ,
It so bechanc ’ d , my fellow citizens
Near <unk> met their enemies in the field ,
And I pray ’ d God to grant what He had will ’ d .
There were they vanquish ’ d , and betook themselves
Unto the bitter passages of flight .
I mark ’ d the hunt , and waxing out of bounds
In gladness , lifted up my shameless brow ,
And like the <unk> <unk> by a gleam ,
Cried , “ It is over . Heav ’ n ! I fear thee not . ”
Upon my verge of life I wish ’ d for peace
With God ; nor repentance had supplied
What I did lack of duty , were it not
The <unk> Piero , touch ’ d with charity ,
In his devout orisons thought on me .
“ But who art thou that question ’ st of our state ,
Who go ’ st to my belief , with lids <unk> ’ d ,
And <unk> in thy talk ? ” — “ Mine eyes , ” said I ,
“ May yet be here ta ’ en from me ; but not long ;
For they have not <unk> <unk>
With envious glances . But the woe beneath
Urges my soul with more exceeding dread .
That nether load already weighs me down . ”
She thus : “ Who then amongst us here aloft
Hath brought thee , if thou <unk> to return ?
“ He , ” answer ’ d I , “ who standeth mute beside me .
I live : of me ask therefore , chosen spirit ,
If thou desire I yonder yet should move
For thee my mortal feet . ” — “ Oh ! ” she replied ,
“ This is so strange a thing , it is great sign
That God doth love thee . Therefore with thy prayer
<unk> assist me : and by that I crave ,
Which most thou <unk> , that if thy feet
E ’ er tread on Tuscan soil , thou save my fame
Amongst my kindred . Them shalt thou behold
With that vain multitude , who set their hope
On <unk> ’ s haven , there to fail
Confounded , more shall when the <unk> stream
They sought of Dian call ’ d : but they who lead
Their <unk> , more than ruin ’ d hopes shall mourn . ”
CANTO XIV
“ Say who is he around our mountain winds ,
Or ever death has prun ’ d his wing for flight ,
That <unk> his eyes and covers them at will ? ”
“ I know not who he is , but know thus much
He comes not singly . Do thou ask of him ,
For thou art nearer to him , and take heed
<unk> him gently , so that he may speak . ”
Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
Toward the other , talk ’ d of me , then both
<unk> me , their faces backward lean ’ d ,
And thus the one began : “ O soul , who yet
Pent in the body , <unk> towards the sky !
For charity , we pray thee ’ comfort us ,
<unk> whence thou com ’ st , and who thou art :
For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
Marvel , as at a thing that ne ’ er hath been . ”
“ There stretches through the midst of Tuscany , ”
I straight began : “ a brooklet , whose <unk>
Springs up in <unk> , with his race
Not satisfied , when he some hundred miles
Hath measur ’ d . From his banks bring , I this frame .
To tell you who I am were words <unk> :
For yet my name scarce sounds on <unk> ’ s lip . ”
“ If well I do <unk> ’ rate with my thought
The meaning of thy speech , ” said he , who first
<unk> me , “ thou dost speak of Arno ’ s wave . ”
To whom the other : “ Why hath he conceal ’ d
The title of that river , as a man
Doth of some horrible thing ? ” The spirit , who
<unk> was question ’ d , did <unk> him thus :
“ I know not : but ’ tis fitting well the name
Should perish of that vale ; for from the source
Where teems so <unk> the Alpine steep
Maim ’ d of <unk> , ( that doth scarcely pass
Beyond that limit , ) even to the point
<unk> ocean is restor ’ d , what heaven
<unk> from th ’ <unk> store for all earth ’ s streams ,
Throughout the space is virtue <unk> down ,
As ’ twere a snake , by all , for mortal foe ,
Or through disastrous influence on the place ,
Or else <unk> of misguided wills ,
That custom goads to evil : whence in those ,
The dwellers in that miserable vale ,
Nature is so transform ’ d , it seems as they
Had shar ’ d of Circe ’ s feeding . ’ Midst brute swine ,
<unk> of acorns than of other food
Created for man ’ s use , he shapeth first
His obscure way ; then , sloping onward , finds
Curs , <unk> more in spite than power , from whom
He turns with scorn aside : still journeying down ,
By how much more the <unk> and luckless foss
<unk> out to <unk> , e ’ en so much it finds
<unk> turning into wolves . Descending still
Through yet more hollow <unk> , next he meets
A race of <unk> , so replete with craft ,
They do not fear that skill can master it .
Nor will I cease because my words are heard
By other ears than thine . It shall be well
For this man , if he keep in memory
What from no erring Spirit I reveal .
Lo ! I behold thy grandson , that becomes
A <unk> of those wolves , upon the shore
Of the fierce stream , and cows them all with dread :
Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale ,
Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms .
Many of life he <unk> , himself of worth
And goodly <unk> . <unk> ’ d with gore
Mark how he issues from the rueful wood ,
Leaving such havoc , that in thousand years
It spreads not to prime <unk> again . ”
As one , who tidings hears of woe to come ,
Changes his looks <unk> ’ d , from whate ’ er part
The peril grasp him , so beheld I change
That spirit , who had turn ’ d to listen , struck
With sadness , soon as he had caught the word .
His visage and the other ’ s speech did raise
Desire in me to know the names of both ,
whereof with meek entreaty I inquir ’ d .
The shade , who late <unk> me , thus resum ’ d :
“ Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine .
But since God ’ s will is that so largely shine
His grace in thee , I will be <unk> too .
Guido of <unk> know then that I am .
<unk> so parch ’ d my blood , that had I seen
A fellow man made joyous , thou hadst mark ’ d
A livid <unk> overspread my cheek .
Such <unk> <unk> I of the seed I sow ’ d .
O man , why place thy heart where there doth need
<unk> of <unk> in good ?
This is Rinieri ’ s spirit , this the boast
And honour of the house of <unk> ,
Where of his worth no heritage remains .
Nor his the only blood , that hath been stript
( ’ twixt Po , the mount , the Reno , and the shore , )
Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss ;
But in those limits such a growth has sprung
Of rank and venom ’ d roots , as long would mock
Slow culture ’ s toil . Where is good <unk> ? where
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ?
O <unk> <unk> of old Romagna ’ s line !
When in Bologna the low <unk> ,
And in Faenza yon <unk> <unk> ,
A gentle <unk> from ignoble stem .
Wonder not , Tuscan , if thou see me weep ,
When I recall to mind those once lov ’ d names ,
Guido of <unk> , and of <unk> him
That dwelt with you ; <unk> and his troop ,
With <unk> ’ s house and <unk> ’ s ,
( Each race <unk> ) and beside these ,
The <unk> and the knights , the toils and ease ,
That <unk> ’ d us into love and courtesy ;
Where now such malice reigns in <unk> hearts .
O <unk> ! wherefore tarriest still ,
Since forth of thee thy family hath gone ,
And many , hating evil , join ’ d their steps ?
Well <unk> he , that bids his lineage cease ,
<unk> ; <unk> ill ,
And <unk> worse , who care to <unk>
A race of <unk> from such blood as theirs .
Well shall ye also do , <unk> , then
When from amongst you <unk> your demon child .
Not so , howe ’ er , that henceforth there remain
True proof of what ye were . O <unk> !
Thou sprung of <unk> ’ s line ! thy name
Is safe , since none is look ’ d for after thee
To cloud its lustre , <unk> from thy stock .
But , Tuscan , go thy ways ; for now I take
Far more delight in weeping than in words .
Such pity for your sakes hath <unk> my heart . ”
We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
Our steps . Their silence therefore of our way
Assur ’ d us . Soon as we had quitted them ,
<unk> onward , lo ! a voice that seem ’ d
Like <unk> light ’ ning , when it rives the air ,
<unk> us , and shouted , “ <unk> finds
Will slay me , ” then fled from us , as the bolt
<unk> ’ d sudden from a <unk> cloud .
When it had giv ’ n short <unk> unto our hearing ,
Behold the other with a crash as loud
As the <unk> thunder : “ Mark in me
<unk> turn ’ d to rock . ” I at the sound
<unk> drew more closely to my guide .
Now in mute stillness rested all the air :
And thus he spake : “ There was the <unk> bit .
But your old enemy so <unk> his hook ,
He <unk> you eager to him . Hence nor curb
<unk> you , nor <unk> call . Heav ’ n calls
And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
With everlasting <unk> . Yet your eye
Turns with fond doting still upon the earth .
Therefore He smites you who <unk> all . ”
CANTO XV
As much as ’ twixt the third hour ’ s close and dawn ,
<unk> of heav ’ n ’ s sphere , that ever whirls
As restless as an infant in his play ,
So much appear ’ d remaining to the sun
Of his slope journey towards the western <unk> .
<unk> was there , and here the noon of night ;
and full upon our forehead smote the beams .
For round the mountain , circling , so our path
Had led us , that toward the <unk> now
Direct we journey ’ d : when I felt a weight
Of more exceeding splendour , than before ,
<unk> on my front . The cause <unk> , amaze
Possess ’ d me , and both hands against my brow
Lifting , I interpos ’ d them , as a screen ,
That of its <unk> <unk> of light
<unk> ’ d the diminish ’ d orb . As when the ray ,
<unk> On water or the surface clear
Of mirror , <unk> unto the opposite part ,
Ascending at a glance , e ’ en as it fell ,
( And so much <unk> from the stone , that falls )
Through equal space , as <unk> skill hath shown ;
Thus with refracted light before me <unk>
The ground there smitten ; whence in sudden haste
My sight <unk> ’ d . “ What is this , sire belov ’ d !
’ Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain ? ”
Cried I , “ and which towards us moving seems ? ”
“ Marvel not , if the family of heav ’ n , ”
He answer ’ d , “ yet with dazzling radiance dim
Thy sense it is a <unk> who comes ,
<unk> man ’ s ascent . Such sights ere long ,
Not grievous , shall impart to thee delight ,
As thy perception is by nature wrought
Up to their pitch . ” The blessed angel , soon
As we had reach ’ d him , hail ’ d us with glad voice :
“ Here enter on a ladder far less steep
Than ye have yet encounter ’ d . ” We forthwith
Ascending , heard behind us <unk> sweet ,
“ Blessed the <unk> , ” and “ happy thou !
That conquer ’ st . ” <unk> each , my guide and I
Pursued our upward way ; and as we went ,
Some profit from his words I <unk> ’ d to win ,
And thus of him inquiring , fram ’ d my speech :
“ What meant Romagna ’ s spirit , when he spake
Of bliss <unk> with no <unk> shar ’ d ? ”
He straight replied : “ No wonder , since he knows ,
What sorrow waits on his own worst defect ,
If he chide others , that they less may mourn .
Because ye point your wishes at a mark ,
Where , by <unk> of <unk> , part
Is <unk> ’ d , envy <unk> up the sighs of men .
No fear of that might touch ye , if the love
Of higher sphere exalted your desire .
For there , by how much more they call it ours ,
So much <unk> of each in good
<unk> more , and <unk> ’ d charity
<unk> that fair cloister in a brighter flame . ”
“ Now lack I satisfaction more , ” said I ,
“ Than if thou hadst been silent at the first ,
And doubt more gathers on my lab ’ ring thought .
How can it chance , that good distributed ,
The many , that possess it , makes more rich ,
Than if ’ t were shar ’ d by few ? ” He answering thus :
“ Thy mind , reverting still to things of earth ,
Strikes darkness from true light . The highest good
<unk> , ineffable , doth so speed
To love , as beam to lucid body darts ,
<unk> as much of ardour as it finds .
The <unk> effluence streams abroad
<unk> , wherever charity extends .
So that the more <unk> to that bliss
Are multiplied , more good is there to love ,
And more is lov ’ d ; as mirrors , that <unk> ,
Each unto other , <unk> light .
If these my words avail not to allay
Thy <unk> , Beatrice thou shalt see ,
Who of this want , and of all else thou hast ,
Shall rid thee to the full . <unk> but thou
That from thy temples may be soon eras ’ d ,
E ’ en as the two already , those five scars ,
That when they pain thee worst , then <unk> heal , ”
“ Thou , ” I had said , “ content ’ st me , ” when I saw
The other round was gain ’ d , and wond ’ ring eyes
Did keep me mute . There suddenly I seem ’ d
By an <unk> vision wrapt away ;
And in a temple saw , methought , a crowd
Of many persons ; and at th ’ entrance stood
A dame , whose sweet <unk> did express
A mother ’ s love , who said , “ <unk> ! why hast thou
<unk> with us thus ? Behold thy sire and I
Sorrowing have sought thee ; ” and so held her peace ,
And straight the vision fled . A female next
Appear ’ d before me , down whose visage <unk> ’ d
Those waters , that grief forces out from one
By deep resentment stung , who seem ’ d to say :
“ If thou , <unk> , be lord indeed
Over this city , nam ’ d with such <unk>
Of adverse gods , and whence each science sparkles ,
<unk> thee of those arms , whose bold embrace
Hath clasp ’ d our daughter ; “ and to fuel , <unk> ’ d ,
Benign and meek , with visage <unk> ’ d ,
Her sovran spake : “ How shall we those requite ,
Who wish us evil , if we thus condemn
The man that loves us ? ” After that I saw
A multitude , in fury burning , slay
With stones a stripling youth , and shout amain
“ Destroy , destroy ! ” and him I saw , who bow ’ d
Heavy with death unto the ground , yet made
His eyes , unfolded upward , gates to heav ’ n ,
<unk> forgiveness of th ’ Almighty Sire ,
Amidst that cruel conflict , on his foes ,
With looks , that With compassion to their aim .
Soon as my spirit , from her airy flight
Returning , sought again the things , whose truth
<unk> not on her <unk> , I observ ’ d
How she had rov ’ d to no <unk> <unk>
Meanwhile the leader , who might see I mov ’ d ,
As one , who <unk> to shake off his sleep ,
Exclaim ’ d : “ What ails thee , that thou canst not hold
Thy footing firm , but more than half a <unk>
Hast travel ’ d with clos ’ d eyes and <unk> ’ ring gait ,
Like to a man by wine or sleep o ’ ercharg ’ d ? ”
“ <unk> father ! so thou deign , ” said I ,
“ To listen , I will tell thee what appear ’ d
Before me , when so fail ’ d my sinking steps . ”
He thus : “ Not if thy <unk> were <unk> ’ d
With hundred <unk> , could a thought of thine
How small soe ’ er , <unk> me . What thou saw ’ st
Was shown , that freely thou mightst ope thy heart
To the waters of peace , that flow <unk> ’ d
From their eternal fountain . I not ask ’ d ,
What ails thee ? for such cause as he doth , who
<unk> only with that eye which sees no more ,
When <unk> the body lies ; but ask ’ d ,
To give fresh vigour to thy foot . Such goads
The slow and loit ’ ring need ; that they be found
Not wanting , when their hour of watch returns . ”
So on we journey ’ d through the evening sky
Gazing intent , far onward , as our eyes
With level view could stretch against the bright
<unk> ray : and lo ! by slow degrees
Gath ’ ring , a fog made tow ’ rds us , dark as night .
There was no room for ’ <unk> ; and that mist
<unk> us , both of sight and the pure air .
CANTO XVI
Hell ’ s <unk> gloom , or night <unk> , dark ,
Of every <unk> ’ reft , and <unk> ’ d in clouds ,
Did never spread before the sight a veil
In <unk> like that fog , nor to the sense
So <unk> and gross . <unk> ’ ring its shade ,
Mine eye <unk> not with unclosed lids ;
Which marking , near me drew the faithful guide ,
<unk> me his shoulder for a stay .
As the blind man behind his leader walks ,
Lest he should err , or <unk> <unk>
On what might harm him , or perhaps destroy ,
I journey ’ d through that bitter air and foul ,
Still list ’ ning to my escort ’ s warning voice ,
“ Look that from me thou part not . ” Straight I heard
<unk> , and each one seem ’ d to pray for peace ,
And for compassion , to the <unk> of God
That <unk> sins away . Their <unk> still
Was “ <unk> <unk> , ” and through all the choir ,
One voice , one measure ran , that perfect seem ’ d
The <unk> of their song . “ Are these I hear
Spirits , O master ? ” I exclaim ’ d ; and he :
“ Thou aim ’ st aright : these loose the bonds of wrath . ”
“ Now who art thou , that through our smoke dost cleave ?
And speak ’ st of us , as thou thyself e ’ en yet
<unk> time by <unk> ? ” So one voice
Bespake me ; whence my master said : “ <unk> ;
And ask , if upward hence the passage lead . ”
“ O being ! who dost make thee pure , to stand
<unk> once more in thy Maker ’ s sight !
Along with me : and thou shalt hear and wonder . ”
Thus I , whereto the spirit answering spake :
“ Long as ’ t is lawful for me , shall my steps
Follow on thine ; and since the <unk> smoke
Forbids the seeing , hearing in its stead
Shall keep us join ’ d . ” I then forthwith began
“ Yet in my mortal <unk> , I ascend
To higher regions , and am hither come
Through the fearful agony of hell .
And , if so largely God hath <unk> his grace ,
That , clean beside all modern <unk> ,
He wills me to behold his kingly state ,
From me conceal not who thou wast , ere death
Had loos ’ d thee ; but instruct me : and instruct
If rightly to the pass I tend ; thy words
The way directing as a safe escort . ”
“ I was of <unk> , and Marco call ’ d :
Not inexperienc ’ d of the world , that worth
I still <unk> , from which all have turn ’ d
The <unk> bow aside . Thy course tends right
Unto the summit : ” and , replying thus ,
He added , “ I beseech thee pray for me ,
When thou shalt come aloft . ” And I to him :
“ <unk> my faith for pledge I will perform
What thou requirest . Yet one doubt remains ,
That wrings me sorely , if I solve it not ,
Singly before it urg ’ d me , <unk> now
By thine opinion , when I <unk> that
With one elsewhere declar ’ d , each strength ’ ning other .
The world indeed is even so forlorn
Of all good as thou speak ’ st it and so <unk>
With every evil . Yet , beseech thee , point
The cause out to me , that myself may see ,
And unto others show it : for in heaven
One places it , and one on earth below . ”
Then <unk> forth a deep and <unk> sigh ,
“ Brother ! ” he thus began , “ the world is blind ;
And thou in truth com ’ st from it . Ye , who live ,
Do so each cause <unk> to heav ’ n above ,
E ’ en as its motion of necessity
Drew with it all that moves . If this were so ,
Free choice in you were none ; nor justice would
There should be joy for virtue , woe for ill .
Your <unk> have their primal bent from heaven ;
Not all ; yet said I all ; what then ensues ?
Light have ye still to follow evil or good ,
And of the will free power , which , if it stand
Firm and unwearied in Heav ’ n ’ s first <unk> ,
<unk> at last , so it be cherish ’ d well ,
<unk> over all . To mightier force ,
To better nature subject , ye abide
Free , not constrain ’ d by that , which forms in you
The reasoning mind <unk> ’ d of the stars .
If then the present race of mankind err ,
Seek in yourselves the cause , and find it there .
<unk> thou shalt confess me no false spy .
“ Forth from his plastic hand , who charm ’ d beholds
Her image ere she yet exist , the soul
Comes like a babe , that <unk> <unk>
Weeping and <unk> in its <unk> <unk> ,
As <unk> and as ignorant of aught ,
Save that her Maker being one who dwells
With gladness ever , willingly she turns
To whate ’ er yields her joy . Of some slight good
The flavour soon she tastes ; and , <unk> ’ d by that ,
With fondness she pursues it , if no guide
<unk> , no rein direct her wand ’ ring course .
Hence it behov ’ d , the law should be a curb ;
A sovereign hence behov ’ d , whose piercing view
Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
Of the true city . <unk> indeed there are :
But who is he <unk> them ? None ; not he ,
Who goes before , the shepherd of the flock ,
Who <unk> the <unk> but doth not cleave the <unk> .
Therefore the multitude , who see their guide
Strike at the very good they covet most ,
<unk> there and look no further . Thus the cause
Is not <unk> nature in yourselves ,
But <unk> , that hath turn ’ d the world
To evil . Rome , that turn ’ d it unto good ,
Was wont to boast two suns , whose several beams
Cast light on either way , the world ’ s and God ’ s .
One since hath quench ’ d the other ; and the sword
Is <unk> on the crook ; and so conjoin ’ d
Each must perforce <unk> to worse , <unk> ’ d
By fear of other . If thou doubt me , mark
The blade : each herb is <unk> ’ d of by its seed .
That land , through which Adice and the Po
Their waters roll , was once the residence
Of courtesy and <unk> , ere the day ,
That <unk> ’ d on Frederick ; now secure may pass
Those limits , whosoe ’ er hath left , for shame ,
To talk with good men , or come near their <unk> .
Three aged ones are still found there , in whom
The old time <unk> the new : these deem it long
Ere God <unk> them to a better world :
The good Gherardo , of <unk> he
Conrad , and Guido of <unk> , nam ’ d
In <unk> phrase more fitly the plain Lombard .
On this at last conclude . The church of Rome ,
<unk> two <unk> that ill <unk> ,
Hath miss ’ d her footing , fall ’ n into the mire ,
And there herself and burden much <unk> ’ d . ”
“ O Marco ! ” I replied , shine arguments
<unk> me : and the cause I now discern
Why of the heritage no portion came
To <unk> ’ s offspring . But resolve me this
Who that Gherardo is , that as thou sayst
Is left a <unk> of the perish ’ d race ,
And for rebuke to this <unk> age ? ”
“ Either thy words , ” said he , “ deceive ; or else
Are meant to try me ; that thou , speaking Tuscan ,
Appear ’ st not to have heard of good <unk> ;
The sole addition that , by which I know him ;
Unless I borrow ’ d from his daughter <unk>
Another name to grace him . God be with you .
I bear you company no more . Behold
The dawn with white ray glimm ’ ring through the mist .
I must away — the angel comes — ere he
Appear . ” He said , and would not hear me more .
CANTO XVII
Call to remembrance , reader , if thou e ’ er
Hast , on a mountain top , been ta ’ en by cloud ,
Through which thou saw ’ st no better , than the mole
Doth through <unk> <unk> ; then , whene ’ er
The wat ’ ry vapours dense began to <unk>
Into <unk> air , how <unk> the sun ’ s sphere
Seem ’ d <unk> through them ; so thy nimble thought
May image , how at first I <unk>
The sun , that <unk> now his couch o ’ <unk> .
Thus with my leader ’ s feet still equaling pace
From forth that cloud I came , when now expir ’ d
The parting beams from off the nether shores .
O quick and <unk> power ! that sometimes dost
So rob us of ourselves , we take no mark
Though round about us thousand trumpets <unk> !
What moves thee , if the senses stir not ? Light
<unk> in heav ’ n , spontaneous , <unk> ’ d ,
Or <unk> <unk> down with swift <unk>
By will divine . <unk> ’ d before me came
The traces of her dire <unk> ,
Whose form was chang ’ d into the bird , that most
<unk> itself in song : and here my mind
Was inwardly so wrapt , it gave no place
To aught that ask ’ d admittance from without .
Next shower ’ d into my <unk> a shape
As of one crucified , whose visage spake
Fell <unk> , malice deep , wherein he died ;
And round him <unk> the great king ,
<unk> his bride , and <unk> the just ,
<unk> in word and deed . As of itself
That <unk> <unk> of the brain
<unk> , like a <unk> , Which the water fails
That fed it ; in my vision straight <unk>
A <unk> weeping loud , and cried , “ O queen !
O mother ! wherefore has <unk> ire
Driv ’ n thee to loath thy being ? Not to lose
Lavinia , <unk> ’ rate thou hast slain thyself .
Now hast thou lost me . I am she , whose tears
Mourn , ere I fall , a mother ’ s <unk> end . ”
E ’ en as a sleep breaks off , if suddenly
New radiance strike upon the closed lids ,
The broken slumber <unk> ere it dies ;
Thus from before me sunk that <unk>
<unk> , soon as on my face there struck
The light , <unk> far our earthly beam .
As round I turn ’ d me to survey what place
I had arriv ’ d at , “ Here ye mount , ” exclaim ’ d
A voice , that other purpose left me none ,
Save will so eager to behold who spake ,
I could not choose but gaze . As ’ fore the sun ,
That weighs our vision down , and veils his form
In light transcendent , thus my virtue fail ’ d
<unk> . “ This is Spirit from above ,
Who marshals us our upward way , <unk> ;
And in his own light <unk> him . As a man
Doth for himself , so now is done for us .
For whoso waits imploring , yet sees need
Of his prompt <unk> , sets himself prepar ’ d
For <unk> denial , ere the suit be made .
<unk> we not to lend a ready foot
At such <unk> : haste we to ascend ,
Before it darken : for we may not then ,
Till morn again return . ” So spake my guide ;
And to one ladder both address ’ d our steps ;
And the first stair approaching , I perceiv ’ d
Near me as ’ twere the <unk> of a wing ,
That fann ’ d my face and whisper ’ d : “ Blessed they
The <unk> : they know not evil wrath . ”
Now to such height above our heads were rais ’ d
The last beams , follow ’ d close by <unk> night ,
That many a star on all sides through the gloom
Shone out . “ Why <unk> from me , O my strength ? ”
So with myself I <unk> ’ d ; for I felt
My o ’ <unk> ’ d sinews slacken . We had reach ’ d
The summit , and were fix ’ d like to a bark
Arriv ’ d at land . And <unk> a short space ,
If aught should meet mine ear in that new round ,
Then to my guide I turn ’ d , and said : “ <unk> ’ d sire !
Declare what guilt is on this circle purg ’ d .
If our feet rest , no need thy speech should pause . ”
He thus to me : “ The love of good , whate ’ er
<unk> of just proportion , here fulfils .
Here plies afresh the oar , that <unk> ’ d ill .
But that thou mayst yet <unk> understand ,
Give ear unto my words , and thou shalt cull
Some fruit may please thee well , from this delay .
“ <unk> , nor created being , ne ’ er ,
My son , ” he thus began , “ was without love ,
Or natural , or the free spirit ’ s growth .
Thou hast not that to learn . The natural still
Is without error ; but the other <unk> ,
If on ill object bent , or through excess
Of vigour , or defect . While e ’ er it seeks
The primal blessings , or with measure due
Th ’ <unk> , no delight , that <unk> from it ,
<unk> of ill . But let it warp to evil ,
Or with more ardour than behooves , or less .
<unk> the good , the thing created then
<unk> ’ gainst its Maker . Hence thou must infer
That love is <unk> of each virtue in ye ,
And of each act no less , that <unk> pain .
Now since it may not be , but love <unk>
The <unk> mainly of the thing it loves ,
All from <unk> are secure ; and since
No being can be thought t ’ exist apart
And <unk> of the first , a bar
Of equal force restrains from hating that .
“ Grant the <unk> just ; and it remains
The ’ evil must be another ’ s , which is lov ’ d .
Three ways such love is <unk> ’ d in your clay .
There is who hopes ( his neighbour ’ s worth <unk> , )
<unk> himself , and <unk> hence
For his own greatness that another fall .
There is who so much fears the loss of power ,
Fame , favour , glory ( should his fellow mount
Above him ) , and so <unk> at the thought ,
He loves their opposite : and there is he ,
Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
That he doth thirst for vengeance , and such needs
Must <unk> on other ’ s evil . Here beneath
This threefold love is mourn ’ d . Of th ’ other sort
Be now instructed , that which follows good
But with disorder ’ d and irregular course .
“ All <unk> apprehend a bliss
On which the soul may rest , the hearts of all
<unk> after it , and to that wished bourn
All therefore strive to tend . If ye behold
Or seek it with a love <unk> and <unk> ,
This cornice after just repenting lays
Its penal torment on ye . Other good
There is , where man finds not his happiness :
It is not true fruition , not that blest
<unk> , of every good the branch and root .
The love too lavishly bestow ’ d on this ,
Along three circles over us , is mourn ’ d .
<unk> of that <unk> <unk>
Expect not , fitter for thine own <unk> . ”
CANTO XVIII
The teacher ended , and his high discourse
<unk> , earnest in my looks inquir ’ d
If I appear ’ d content ; and I , whom still
<unk> thirst to hear him urg ’ d , was mute ,
<unk> <unk> , yet inwardly I said :
“ Perchance my too much questioning offends . ”
But he , true father , mark ’ d the secret wish
By <unk> restrain ’ d , and speaking , gave
Me <unk> thus to speak : “ Master , my <unk>
<unk> so lively virtue from thy beams ,
That all , thy words convey , distinct is seen .
Wherefore I pray thee , father , whom this heart
<unk> dearest ! thou wouldst deign by proof t ’ unfold
That love , from which as from their source thou bring ’ st
All good deeds and their opposite . ” He then :
“ To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
Directed , and thou plainly shalt behold
How much those blind have err ’ d , who make themselves
The guides of men . The soul , created apt
To love , moves <unk> which way soe ’ er
Aught pleasing prompts her , soon as she is wak ’ d
By pleasure into act . Of substance true
Your apprehension forms its counterfeit ,
And in you the <unk> shape <unk>
Attracts the soul ’ s regard . If she , thus drawn ,
<unk> toward it , love is that inclining ,
And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye .
Then as the fire points up , and mounting seeks
His birth-place and his lasting seat , e ’ en thus
Enters the captive soul into desire ,
Which is a spiritual motion , that ne ’ er rests
Before <unk> of the thing it loves .
Enough to show thee , how the truth from those
Is hidden , who <unk> all love a thing
<unk> in itself : although perhaps
Its substance seem still good . Yet if the wax
Be good , it follows not th ’ impression must . ”
“ What love is , ” I return ’ d , “ thy words , O guide !
And my own <unk> mind , reveal . Yet thence
New doubts have sprung . For from without if love
Be offer ’ d to us , and the spirit knows
No other footing , tend she right or wrong ,
Is no desert of <unk> . ” He answering thus :
“ What reason here discovers I have power
To show thee : that which lies beyond , expect
From Beatrice , faith not reason ’ s task .
Spirit , <unk> form , with matter join ’ d
Not in confusion mix ’ d , hath in itself
<unk> virtue of that <unk> born ,
Which is not felt except it work , nor prov ’ d
But through effect , as <unk> life
By the green leaf . From whence his intellect
<unk> its primal <unk> of things ,
Man therefore knows not , or his <unk>
Their first affections ; such in you , as zeal
In bees to gather <unk> ; at the first ,
<unk> , <unk> nor blame nor praise .
But o ’ er each lower faculty supreme ,
That as she list are <unk> ’ d to her bar ,
Ye have that virtue in you , whose just voice
<unk> counsel , and whose word should keep
The threshold of assent . Here is the source ,
Whence cause of merit in you is deriv ’ d ,
E ’ en as the affections good or ill she takes ,
Or severs , <unk> ’ d as the <unk> . Those men
Who <unk> ’ ning went to depth profoundest , mark ’ d
That <unk> <unk> , and were thence induc ’ d
To leave their moral <unk> to the world .
Grant then , that from necessity arise
All love that <unk> within you ; to dismiss
Or <unk> it , the pow ’ r is in yourselves .
Remember , Beatrice , in her style ,
<unk> free choice by eminence
The noble virtue , if in talk with thee
She touch upon that theme . ” The moon , well nigh
To midnight hour <unk> , made the stars
Appear to <unk> and fade ; and her broad <unk>
Seem ’ d like a crag on fire , as up the vault
That course she journey ’ d , which the sun then warms ,
When they of Rome behold him at his set .
Betwixt Sardinia and the <unk> isle .
And now the weight , that hung upon my thought ,
Was lighten ’ d by the aid of that clear spirit ,
Who <unk> <unk> above Mantua ’ s name .
I therefore , when my questions had obtain ’ d
<unk> plain and ample , stood as one
<unk> in <unk> slumber ; but not long
<unk> ’ d ; for suddenly a multitude ,
The steep already turning , from behind ,
Rush ’ d on . With fury and like random rout ,
As <unk> on their shores at midnight heard
<unk> and <unk> , for his Thebes
If Bacchus ’ help were needed ; so came these
<unk> , <unk> each his rapid step ,
By eagerness impell ’ d of holy love .
Soon they o ’ ertook us ; with such swiftness mov ’ d
The mighty crowd . Two spirits at their head
Cried weeping ; “ Blessed Mary sought with haste
The <unk> region . Caesar to <unk>
<unk> , darted in <unk> his sting ,
And flew to <unk> . ” — “ Oh tarry not : away ; ”
The others shouted ; “ let not time be lost
Through <unk> of affection . <unk> zeal
To serve <unk> celestial grace . ”
“ O ye , in whom intenser <unk>
Haply <unk> , where <unk> erst ye fail ’ d ,
Slow or <unk> , to absolve your part
Of good and virtuous , this man , who yet lives ,
( <unk> my tale , though strange ) desires t ’ ascend ,
So morning rise to light us . Therefore say
Which hand leads nearest to the <unk> rock ? ”
So spake my guide , to whom a shade return ’ d :
“ Come after us , and thou shalt find the cleft .
We may not linger : such <unk> will
<unk> our unwearied course . Vouchsafe us then
Thy pardon , if our duty seem to thee
<unk> <unk> . In Verona I
Was <unk> of <unk> Zeno , when the hand
Of <unk> grasp ’ d <unk> sway ,
That name , ne ’ er utter ’ d without tears in Milan .
And there is he , hath one foot in his grave ,
Who for that <unk> ere long shall weep ,
<unk> his power <unk> ’ d : for that his son ,
Of body ill compact , and worse in mind ,
And born in evil , he hath set in place
Of its true pastor . ” <unk> more he spake ,
Or here was mute , I know not : he had sped
E ’ en now so far beyond us . Yet thus much
I heard , and in <unk> ’ rance treasur ’ d it .
He then , who never fail ’ d me at my need ,
Cried , “ Hither turn . Lo ! two with sharp remorse
<unk> their sin ! ” In rear of all the troop
These shouted : “ First they died , to whom the sea
Open ’ d , or ever <unk> saw his heirs :
And they , who with Aeneas to the end
Endur ’ d not suffering , for their portion chose
<unk> without glory . ” Soon as they had fled
Past reach of sight , new thought within me rose
By others follow ’ d fast , and each unlike
Its fellow : till led on from thought to thought ,
And <unk> ’ d with the <unk> train , mine eye
Was clos ’ d , and <unk> chang ’ d to dream .
CANTO XIX
It was the hour , when of <unk> heat
No <unk> <unk> the cold beams of the moon ,
O ’ erpower ’ d by earth , or <unk> sway
Of Saturn ; and the <unk> sees
His <unk> <unk> up the east ascend ,
Where <unk> dawn <unk> first the shadowy <unk> ;
When ’ fore me in my dream a woman ’ s shape
There came , with lips that <unk> ’ d , eyes <unk> ,
Distorted feet , hands maim ’ d , and colour pale .
I look ’ d upon her ; and as <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> ’ d by <unk> cold , e ’ en thus my look
<unk> ’ d her tongue , next in brief space her form
<unk> rais ’ d erect , and <unk> face
With love ’ s own hue <unk> ’ d . <unk> ’ ring speech
She forthwith warbling such a strain began ,
That I , how loth soe ’ er , could scarce have held
<unk> from the song . “ I , ” thus she sang ,
“ I am the <unk> , she , whom mariners
On the wide sea are <unk> ’ d when they hear :
Such <unk> of delight the list ’ <unk> feels .
I from his course Ulysses by my lay
<unk> drew . Whoe ’ er <unk> me once
<unk> seldom ; so I charm him , and his heart
Contented knows no void . ” Or ere her mouth
Was clos ’ d , to shame her at her side appear ’ d
A dame of semblance holy . With stern voice
She utter ’ d ; “ Say , O Virgil , who is this ? ”
Which hearing , he approach ’ d , with eyes still bent
Toward that goodly presence : th ’ other seiz ’ d her ,
And , her <unk> tearing , open ’ d her before ,
And show ’ d the belly to me , whence a smell ,
<unk> loathsome , wak ’ d me . Round I turn ’ d
Mine eyes , and thus the teacher : “ At the least
Three times my voice hath call ’ d thee . Rise , <unk> .
Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass . ”
I straightway rose . Now day , pour ’ d down from high ,
<unk> ’ d all the <unk> of the sacred mount ;
And , as we journey ’ d , on our shoulder smote
The early ray . I follow ’ d , stooping low
My forehead , as a man , o ’ ercharg ’ d with thought ,
Who bends him to the <unk> of an arch ,
That midway <unk> the flood ; when thus I heard ,
“ Come , enter here , ” in tone so soft and mild ,
As never met the ear on mortal strand .
With <unk> wings <unk> and <unk> up ,
Who thus had spoken <unk> ’ d us along ,
Where each side of the solid <unk>
The sloping , walls retir ’ d ; then mov ’ d his plumes ,
And <unk> us , <unk> ’ d that those , who mourn ,
Are blessed , for that comfort shall be theirs .
“ What <unk> thee , that still thou look ’ st to earth ? ”
Began my leader ; while th ’ angelic shape
A little over us his station took .
“ New vision , ” I replied , “ hath rais ’ d in me
<unk> strange and anxious doubts , whereon
My soul intent allows no other thought
Or room or entrance . ” — “ Hast thou seen , ” said he ,
“ That old <unk> , her , whose wiles alone
The spirits o ’ er us weep for ? Hast thou seen
How man may free him of her bonds ? Enough .
Let thy heels <unk> the earth , and thy rais ’ d ken
Fix on the lure , which heav ’ n ’ s eternal King
<unk> in the rolling spheres . ” As on his feet
The falcon first looks down , then to the sky
Turns , and forth stretches eager for the food ,
That <unk> him thither ; so the call I heard ,
So onward , far as the <unk> rock
Gave way , I journey ’ d , till the plain was reach ’ d .
On the fifth circle when I stood at large ,
A race appear ’ d before me , on the ground
All downward <unk> prone and weeping sore .
“ My soul hath <unk> to the dust , ” I heard
With sighs so deep , they well nigh <unk> ’ d the words .
“ O ye <unk> of God , whose penal woes
Both hope and justice <unk> , direct
Tow ’ rds the steep rising our uncertain way . ”
“ If ye approach secure from this our doom ,
<unk> — and would urge your course with speed ,
See that ye still to rightward keep the brink . ”
So them the bard besought ; and such the words ,
Beyond us some short space , in answer came .
I noted what remain ’ d yet hidden from them :
Thence to my liege ’ s eyes mine eyes I bent ,
And he , forthwith <unk> their suit ,
<unk> ’ d his glad assent . Free then to act ,
As pleas ’ d me , I drew near , and took my stand
<unk> that shade , whose words I late had mark ’ d .
And , “ Spirit ! ” I said , “ in whom repentant tears
<unk> that blessed hour , when thou with God
Shalt find <unk> , for a while <unk>
For me that mightier care . Say who thou wast ,
Why thus ye <unk> on your <unk> prone ,
And if in aught ye wish my service there ,
Whence living I am come . ” He answering spake
“ The cause why Heav ’ n our back toward his cope
<unk> , shalt thou know : but me know first
The successor of Peter , and the name
And title of my lineage from that stream ,
That ’ twixt <unk> and <unk> draws
His limpid waters through the lowly <unk> .
A <unk> and little more by proof I learnt ,
With what a weight that robe of sov ’ <unk>
Upon his shoulder rests , who from the mire
Would guard it : that each other fardel seems
But feathers in the <unk> . <unk> , alas !
Was my conversion : but when I became
Rome ’ s pastor , I discern ’ d at once the dream
And <unk> of life , saw that the heart
<unk> not there , and yet no <unk> height
<unk> ’ d on the <unk> : wherefore , of that life
No more enamour ’ d , in my bosom love
Of <unk> being kindled . For till then
I was a soul in misery , <unk>
From God , and covetous of all earthly things ;
Now , as thou seest , here punish ’ d for my doting .
Such <unk> from the taint of avarice
Do spirits <unk> need . This mount inflicts
No direr penalty . E ’ en as our eyes
<unk> ’ d below , nor e ’ er to loftier clime
Were lifted , thus hath justice level ’ d us
Here on the earth . As avarice quench ’ d our love
Of good , without which is no working , thus
Here justice holds us prison ’ d , hand and foot
<unk> ’ d down and bound , while heaven ’ s just Lord shall please .
So long to tarry motionless outstretch ’ d . ”
My knees I stoop ’ d , and would have spoke ; but he ,
Ere my beginning , by his ear perceiv ’ d
I did him reverence ; and “ What cause , ” said he ,
“ Hath bow ’ d thee thus ! ” — “ <unk> , ” I rejoin ’ d .
“ And inward awe of your high dignity . ”
“ Up , ” he exclaim ’ d , “ brother ! upon thy feet
Arise : err not : thy fellow servant I ,

If thou hast ever mark ’ d those holy sounds
Of <unk> truth , ‘ nor shall be given ill <unk> , ’
Thou mayst discern the <unk> of my speech .
Go thy ways now ; and linger here no more .
Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears ,
With which I hasten that whereof thou spak ’ st .

And she is all <unk> of me there . ”

His pleasure therefore to mine own <unk> ’ d ,
I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave .
Onward I mov ’ d : he also onward mov ’ d ,
Who led me , coasting still , wherever place
Along the rock was vacant , as a man
Walks near the <unk> on narrow wall .
For those on th ’ other part , who drop by drop

Too closely press the verge . <unk> be thou !

And , ’ midst the wailing , one before us heard

In the sharp pangs of <unk> ; and “ How poor
Thou wast , ” it added , “ witness that low roof
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down .
O good <unk> ! thou didst virtue choose
With <unk> , before great wealth with vice . ”
The words so pleas ’ d me , that desire to know
The spirit , from whose lip they seem ’ d to come ,
Did draw me onward . Yet it spake the gift
Of <unk> , which on the maidens he
<unk> bestow ’ d , to save their youthful prime
<unk> ’ d . “ Spirit ! who dost speak of deeds
So worthy , tell me who thou was , ” I said ,
“ And why thou dost with single voice renew
<unk> of such praise . That boon vouchsaf ’ d
Haply shall meet reward ; if I return
To finish the Short <unk> of life ,
Still speeding to its close on restless wing . ”
“ I , ” answer ’ d he , “ will tell thee , not for hell ,
Which thence I look for ; but that in thyself

To Italy came Charles , and for amends
Young <unk> an innocent victim slew ,
And sent th ’ angelic teacher back to heav ’ n ,

To make himself and kindred better known .

The <unk> of poor Florence . No increase
Of territory hence , but sin and shame

As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong .
I see the other , who a <unk> late

His daughter , whom he <unk> for , as do
The <unk> for their slaves . O avarice !

So wholly to thyself , they feel no care
Of their own flesh ? To hide with direr guilt
Past ill and future , lo ! the <unk>
Enters <unk> ! in his <unk> Christ

The <unk> and gall once more <unk> !
And he ’ twixt living robbers doom ’ d to <unk> !
Lo ! the new <unk> , of whose cruelty
Such violence cannot fill the measure up ,
With no degree to <unk> , <unk> on
Into the temple his yet eager sails !
“ O sovran Master ! when shall I rejoice
To see the vengeance , which thy wrath well-pleas ’ d

Therefore , not singly , I erewhile <unk> ’ d

From him we now had parted , and essay ’ d
With utmost <unk> to <unk> the way ,

So shook not <unk> , when <unk> there

Forthwith from every side a shout arose
So vehement , that suddenly my guide
Drew near , and cried : “ <unk> not , while I conduct thee . ”
“ Glory ! ” all shouted ( such the sounds mine ear

“ Glory in the highest be to God . ” We stood

The shepherds , who first heard in <unk> ’ s field
That song : till ceas ’ d the trembling , and the song
Was ended : then our hallow ’ d path resum ’ d ,

As in that moment ; nor through haste dar ’ d I

When lo ! even as <unk> <unk> , that Christ
Appear ’ d unto the two upon their way ,
<unk> from his vaulted grave ; to us
A shade appear ’ d , and after us approach ’ d ,
<unk> the crowd beneath its feet .
We were not ware of it ; so first it spake ,
Saying , “ God give you peace , my brethren ! ” then
Sudden we turn ’ d : and Virgil such <unk> ,
As <unk> that kind greeting , gave , and cried :
“ Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
<unk> by that righteous court , which me
To everlasting banishment <unk> ! ”
“ How ! ” he exclaim ’ d , nor from his speed meanwhile
<unk> , “ If that ye be spirits , whom God
<unk> not room above , who up the height
Has been thus far your guide ? ” To whom the bard :
“ If thou observe the tokens , which this man
Trac ’ d by the finger of the angel bears ,
’ Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
He needs must share . But <unk> she , whose wheel
<unk> day and night , for him not yet had drawn
That <unk> , which , on the fatal <unk> pil ’ d ,
<unk> <unk> to each <unk> that breathes ,
His soul , that sister is to mine and thine ,
Not of herself could mount , for not like ours
Her ken : whence I , from forth the ample gulf
Of hell was ta ’ en , to lead him , and will lead
Far as my lore avails . But , if thou know ,
Instruct us for what cause , the mount erewhile
Thus shook and trembled : wherefore all at once
Seem ’ d shouting , even from his <unk> ’ d foot . ”
That questioning so <unk> with my wish ,
The thirst did feel <unk> of its edge
E ’ en from <unk> . He forthwith replied ,
“ In its <unk> nought irregular
This mount can witness , or by <unk> rule
<unk> ’ d ; here from every change exempt .
Other than that , which heaven in itself
Doth of itself <unk> , no influence
Can reach us . <unk> none , shower , hail or snow ,
<unk> frost or <unk> moistness , higher falls
Than that brief scale of threefold steps : thick clouds
Nor <unk> rack are ever seen : swift glance
Ne ’ er lightens , nor <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
That yonder often shift on each side heav ’ n .
<unk> <unk> doth never mount above
The highest of the trinal stairs , whereon
Peter ’ s <unk> stands . <unk> perchance ,
With various motion rock ’ d , <unk> the soil :
But here , through wind in earth ’ s deep hollow pent ,
I know not how , yet never trembled : then
<unk> , when any spirit feels itself
So purified , that it may rise , or move
For rising , and such loud <unk> ensues .
<unk> by the will alone
Is prov ’ d , that free to change <unk>
<unk> the soul <unk> in her will .
Desire of bliss is present from the first ;
But strong <unk> <unk> , to that wish
By the just <unk> of heav ’ n oppos ’ d ;
<unk> now as eager to <unk>
Th ’ <unk> torment , as erewhile to sin .
And I who in this punishment had lain
Five hundred years and more , but now have felt
Free wish for happier clime . Therefore thou felt ’ st
The mountain tremble , and the spirits devout
Heard ’ st , over all his limits , utter praise
To that liege Lord , whom I entreat their joy
To hasten . ” Thus he spake : and since the <unk>
Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen ,
No words may speak my fullness of content .
“ Now , ” said the instructor sage , “ I see the net
That takes ye here , and how the toils are loos ’ d ,
Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice .
Vouchsafe , that from thy lips I next may learn ,
Who on the earth thou wast , and wherefore here
So many an age wert prostrate . ” — “ In that time ,
When the good <unk> , with Heav ’ n ’ s King to help ,
<unk> ’ d those piteous gashes , whence the blood
By Judas <unk> did issue , with the name
Most lasting and most honour ’ d there was I
<unk> renown ’ d , ” the shade reply ’ d ,
“ Not yet with faith endued . So passing sweet
My <unk> Spirit , from <unk> , Rome
To herself drew me , where I merited
A <unk> garland to <unk> my brow .
Statius they name me still . Of Thebes I sang ,
And next of great Achilles : but i ’ th ’ way
Fell with the second <unk> . Of my flame
Those sparkles were the seeds , which I deriv ’ d
From the bright fountain of celestial fire
That <unk> <unk> ’ d lamps , the song I mean
Which sounds Aeneas ’ wand ’ rings : that the breast
I hung at , that the <unk> , from whom my veins
<unk> <unk> : whose authority
Was ever sacred with me . To have liv ’ d
<unk> with the Mantuan , I would bide
The <unk> of another sun
Beyond my <unk> years in banishment . ”
The Mantuan , when he heard him , turn ’ d to me ,
And <unk> silence : by his countenance
<unk> ’ d me silence but the power which wills ,
Bears not supreme <unk> : laughter and tears
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them ,
They wait not for the <unk> of the will
In natures most <unk> . I did but smile ,
As one who <unk> ; and <unk> the shade
Broke off , and peer ’ d into mine eyes , where best
Our looks interpret . “ So to good event
<unk> thou conduct such great emprize , ” he cried ,
“ Say , why across thy visage beam ’ d , but now ,
The lightning of a smile ! ” On either part
Now am I straiten ’ d ; one <unk> me speak ,
Th ’ other to silence binds me : whence a sigh
I utter , and the sigh is heard . “ Speak on ; ”
The teacher cried ; “ and do not fear to speak ,
But tell him what so earnestly he asks . ”
Whereon I thus : “ Perchance , O ancient spirit !
Thou marvel ’ st at my smiling . There is room
For yet more wonder . He who guides my ken
On high , he is that Mantuan , led by whom
Thou didst presume of men and gods to sing .
If other cause thou deem ’ dst for which I smil ’ d ,
<unk> it as not the true one ; and believe
Those words , thou spak ’ st of him , indeed the cause . ”
Now down he bent t ’ embrace my teacher ’ s feet ;
But he <unk> him : “ Brother ! do it not :
Thou art a shadow , and behold ’ st a shade . ”
He rising answer ’ d thus : “ Now hast thou prov ’ d
The force and ardour of the love I bear thee ,
When I <unk> we are but things of air ,
And as a substance treat an empty shade . ”
CANTO XXII
Now we had left the angel , who had turn ’ d
To the sixth circle our <unk> step ,
One gash from off my forehead raz ’ d : while they ,
Whose wishes tend to justice , shouted forth :
“ Blessed ! ” and ended with , “ I thirst : ” and I ,
More nimble than along the other straits ,
So journey ’ d , that , without the sense of toil ,
I follow ’ d upward the <unk> shades ;
When Virgil thus began : “ Let its pure flame
From virtue flow , and love can never fail
To warm another ’ s bosom ’ so the light
Shine <unk> forth . Hence from that hour ,
When ’ <unk> us in the purlieus of the deep ,
Came down the spirit of <unk> ’ s hard ,
Who told of thine affection , my good will
Hath been for thee of <unk> as strong
As ever <unk> ’ d itself to one not seen .
Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me .
But tell me : and if too secure I loose
The rein with a friend ’ s <unk> , as a friend
<unk> me , and speak now as with a friend :
How chanc ’ d it covetous desire could find
<unk> in that bosom , ’ midst such ample store
Of wisdom , as thy zeal had treasur ’ d there ? ”
First somewhat mov ’ d to laughter by his words ,
Statius replied : “ Each syllable of thine
Is a dear pledge of love . Things oft appear
That minister false matters to our doubts ,
When their true <unk> are remov ’ d from sight .
Thy question doth assure me , thou believ ’ st
I was on earth a covetous man , perhaps
Because thou found ’ st me in that circle plac ’ d .
Know then I was too wide of avarice :
And e ’ en for that excess , thousands of moons
Have wax ’ d and wan ’ d upon my <unk> .
And were it not that I with heedful care
<unk> where thou exclaim ’ st as if in ire
With human nature , ‘ Why , thou cursed thirst
Of gold ! dost not with <unk> measure guide
The appetite of mortals ? ’ I had met
The fierce encounter of the voluble rock .
Then was I ware that with too ample wing
The hands may haste to lavishment , and turn ’ d ,
As from my other evil , so from this
In penitence . How many from their grave
Shall with shorn locks arise , who living , aye
And at life ’ s last extreme , of this offence ,
Through ignorance , did not repent . And know ,
The fault which lies direct from any sin
In level <unk> , here With that
<unk> its green <unk> on one common heap .
Therefore if I have been with those , who wail
Their avarice , to cleanse me , through reverse
Of their transgression , such hath been my lot . ”
To whom the sovran of the <unk> song :
“ While thou didst sing that cruel warfare <unk> ’ d
By the <unk> sorrow of <unk> ’ s womb ,
From thy discourse with <unk> there , it seems
As faith had not been shine : without the which
Good deeds suffice not . And if so , what sun
Rose on thee , or what <unk> pierc ’ d the dark
That thou didst after see to <unk> the sail ,
And follow , where the <unk> had led ? ”
He answering thus : “ By thee conducted first ,
I enter ’ d the Parnassian <unk> , and <unk> ’ d
Of the clear spring ; <unk> ’ d first by thee
Open ’ d mine eyes to God . Thou didst , as one ,
Who , journeying through the darkness , hears a light
Behind , that profits not himself , but makes
His followers wise , when thou <unk> , ‘ Lo !
A <unk> world ! Justice return ’ d !
<unk> of primeval innocence restor ’ d !
And a new race descended from above ! ’
Poet and Christian both to thee I <unk> .
That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace ,
My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
With livelier <unk> . Soon o ’ er all the world ,
By messengers from heav ’ n , the true belief
<unk> ’ d now prolific , and that word of thine
<unk> , to the new <unk> <unk> ’ d .
<unk> ’ d by which <unk> , I was wont
<unk> to them ; and soon their <unk>
So won upon me , that , <unk> ’ s rage
Pursuing them , I mix ’ d my tears with theirs ,
And , while on earth I stay ’ d , still succour ’ d them ;
And their most righteous <unk> made me scorn
All <unk> besides . Before I led the Greeks
In tuneful fiction , to the streams of Thebes ,
I was <unk> ’ d ; but <unk> , through fear ,
<unk> ’ d a Christian , and <unk> ’ d long time
To <unk> <unk> . Five <unk> and more ,
T for that <unk> was fain to pace
Round the fourth circle . Thou then , who hast rais ’ d
The <unk> , which did hide such <unk> from me ,
Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb ,
Say , if thou know , where our old <unk> bides ,
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> : if condemn ’ d
They dwell , and in what <unk> of the deep . ”
“ These , ” said my guide , “ with <unk> and myself ,
And others many more , are with that Greek ,
Of mortals , the most cherish ’ d by the Nine ,
In the first ward of darkness . There ofttimes
We of that mount hold converse , on whose top
For aye our <unk> live . We have the bard
Of <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> , and many a <unk> else
<unk> with laurel . Of thy train
<unk> is there , <unk> ,
<unk> , and as sorrowful as erst
<unk> , and who show ’ d <unk> ’ s wave :
Deidamia with her sisters there ,
And blind Tiresias ’ daughter , and the bride
<unk> of <unk> . ” Either poet now
Was silent , and no longer by th ’ ascent
Or the steep walls <unk> , round them cast
<unk> eyes . Four handmaids of the day
Had finish ’ d now their office , and the fifth
Was at the <unk> , directing still
Its <unk> point aloof , when thus my guide :
“ Methinks , it well behooves us to the brink
Bend the right shoulder ’ <unk> the mount ,
As we have ever us ’ d . ” So custom there
Was usher to the road , the which we chose
Less doubtful , as that worthy shade <unk> .
They on before me went ; I sole pursued ,
List ’ ning their speech , that to my thoughts convey ’ d
Mysterious <unk> of sweet <unk> .
But soon they ceas ’ d ; for midway of the road
A tree we found , with goodly fruitage hung ,
And pleasant to the smell : and as a <unk>
Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads ,
So downward this less ample spread , that none .
Methinks , aloft may climb . Upon the side ,
That clos ’ d our path , a <unk> crystal fell
From the steep rock , and through the sprays above
Stream ’ d showering . With associate step the bards
Drew near the plant ; and from amidst the leaves
A voice was heard : “ Ye shall be <unk> of me ; ”
And after added : “ Mary took more thought
For joy and honour of the <unk> feast ,
Than for herself who answers now for you .
The women of old Rome were satisfied
With water for their beverage . Daniel fed
On pulse , and wisdom gain ’ d . The primal age
Was beautiful as gold ; and hunger then
Made acorns <unk> , thirst each <unk>
Run nectar . <unk> and <unk> were the food ,
Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
Fed , and that eminence of glory reach ’ d
And greatness , which the ’ Evangelist records . ”
CANTO XXIII
On the green leaf mine eyes were fix ’ d , like his
Who throws away his days in idle chase
Of the <unk> , when thus I heard
The more than father warn me : “ Son ! our time
<unk> <unk> using . Linger not : away . ”
Thereat my face and steps at once I turn ’ d
Toward the sages , by whose converse cheer ’ d
I journey ’ d on , and felt no toil : and lo !
A sound of weeping and a song : “ My lips ,
O Lord ! ” and these so mingled , it gave birth
To pleasure and to pain . “ O Sire , belov ’ d !
Say what is this I hear ? ” Thus I inquir ’ d .
“ Spirits , ” said he , “ who as they go , perchance ,
Their debt of duty pay . ” As on their road
The thoughtful <unk> , <unk> some
Not known unto them , turn to them , and look ,
But stay not ; thus , approaching from behind
With speedier motion , <unk> us , as they pass ’ d ,
A crowd of spirits , silent and devout .
The eyes of each were dark and hollow : pale
Their visage , and so lean <unk> , the bones
Stood staring <unk> ’ the skin . I do not think
Thus dry and <unk> <unk> show ’ d ,
When <unk> ’ <unk> by <unk> famine to the quick .
“ Lo ! ” to myself I <unk> ’ d , “ the race , who lost
<unk> , when Mary with dire beak
Prey ’ d on her child . ” The <unk> seem ’ d as rings ,
From which the <unk> were drops . Who <unk> the name
Of man upon his forehead , there the <unk>
Had trac ’ d most plainly . Who would deem , that <unk>
Of water and an <unk> , could have prov ’ d
<unk> to <unk> such <unk> want ,
Not knowing how it wrought ? While now I stood
Wond ’ ring what thus could waste them ( for the cause
Of their gaunt <unk> and scaly rind
Appear ’ d not ) lo ! a spirit turn ’ d his eyes
In their <unk> <unk> , and fasten ’ d then
On me , then cried with <unk> aloud :
“ What grace is this vouchsaf ’ d me ? ” By his looks
I ne ’ er had recogniz ’ d him : but the voice
<unk> to my knowledge what his cheer conceal ’ d .
Remembrance of his alter ’ d lineaments
Was kindled from that spark ; and I agniz ’ d
The visage of Forese . “ Ah ! respect
This wan and leprous wither ’ d skin , ” thus he
<unk> implor ’ d , “ this <unk> flesh .
Speak to me truly of thyself . And who
Are those twain spirits , that escort thee there ?
Be it not said thou <unk> ’ st to talk with me . ”
“ That face of thine , ” I answer ’ d him , “ which dead
I once <unk> ’ d , <unk> me not less
For weeping , when I see It thus transform ’ d .
Say then , by Heav ’ n , what blasts ye thus ? The whilst
I wonder , ask not <unk> from me : <unk>
Is he to speak , whom other will <unk> . ”
He thus : “ The water and <unk> plant we pass ’ d ,
Virtue <unk> , by th ’ eternal will
<unk> ’ d , the which so pines me . <unk> spirit ,
Whose song <unk> his gluttony <unk> ’ d
Too <unk> , here in hunger and in thirst
Is purified . The odour , which the fruit ,
And <unk> , that showers upon the verdure , breathe ,
<unk> us with desire to feed and drink .
Nor once alone encompassing our route
We come to add fresh fuel to the pain :
Pain , said I ? solace rather : for that will
To the tree leads us , by which Christ was led
To call Elias , joyful when he paid
Our <unk> from his vein . ” I answering thus :
“ Forese ! from that day , in which the world
For better life thou <unk> , not five years
Have circled . If the power of sinning more
Were first concluded in thee , ere thou knew ’ st
That kindly grief , which <unk> us
To God , how hither art thou come so soon ?
I thought to find thee lower , there , where time
Is recompense for time . ” He straight replied :
“ To drink up the sweet <unk> of affliction
I have been brought thus early by the tears
Stream ’ d down my <unk> ’ s cheeks . Her prayers devout ,
Her sighs have drawn me from the coast , where oft
Expectance lingers , and have set me free
From th ’ other circles . In the sight of God
So much the <unk> is my widow priz ’ d ,
She whom I lov ’ d so <unk> , as she ranks
More singly eminent for virtuous deeds .
The tract most <unk> ’ rous of Sardinia ’ s isle ,
Hath dames more chaste and <unk> by far
Than that wherein I left her . O sweet brother !
What wouldst thou have me say ? A time to come
Stands full within my view , to which this hour
Shall not be <unk> of an ancient date ,
When from the <unk> shall be <unk> warn ’ d
Th ’ <unk> dames of Florence , lest they bare
<unk> ’ d bosoms to the common gaze .
What savage women hath the world e ’ er seen ,
What Saracens , for whom there needed scourge
Of spiritual or other <unk> ,
To force them walk with cov ’ ring on their limbs !
But did they see , the shameless ones , that Heav ’ n
<unk> on swift wing toward them , while I speak ,
Their mouths were op ’ d for <unk> : they shall taste
Of Borrow ( unless foresight <unk> me here )
Or ere the cheek of him be cloth ’ d with down
Who is now rock ’ d with <unk> <unk> .
Ah ! now , my brother , hide thyself no more ,
Thou seest how not I alone but all
<unk> , where thou veil ’ st the <unk> sun . ”
Whence I replied : “ If thou recall to mind
What we were once together , even yet
Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore .
That I forsook that life , was due to him
Who there <unk> me , some few <unk> past ,
When she was round , who shines with sister lamp
To his , that <unk> yonder , ” and I show ’ d
The sun . “ Tis he , who through profoundest night
Of he true dead has brought me , with this flesh
As true , that follows . From that gloom the aid
Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb ,
And climbing wind along this <unk> ,
Which <unk> in you whate ’ er the world
Made crooked and <unk> ’ d I have his word ,
That he will bear me company as far
As till I come where Beatrice dwells :
But there must leave me . Virgil is that spirit ,
Who thus hath promis ’ d , ” and I pointed to him ;
“ The other is that shade , for whom so late
Your realm , as he arose , <unk> shook
Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound . ”
CANTO XXIV
Our journey was not slacken ’ d by our talk ,
Nor yet our talk by journeying . Still we spake ,
And urg ’ d our travel stoutly , like a ship
When the wind sits <unk> . The shadowy forms ,
That seem ’ d things dead and dead again , drew in
At their <unk> orbs rare wonder of me ,
<unk> I had life ; and I my words
<unk> , and thus spake ; “ He journeys up
Perhaps more <unk> then else he would ,
For others ’ sake . But tell me , if thou know ’ st ,
Where is Piccarda ? Tell me , if I see
Any of mark , among this multitude ,
Who eye me thus . ” — “ My sister ( she for whom ,
’ Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
Which name was fitter ) wears e ’ en now her crown ,
And <unk> in <unk> . ” Saying this ,
He added : “ Since <unk> <unk> hath so worn
Our semblance out , ’ t is lawful here to name
Each one . This , ” and his finger then he rais ’ d ,
“ Is Buonaggiuna , — Buonaggiuna , he
Of Lucca : and that face beyond him , pierc ’ d
Unto a <unk> <unk> than the rest ,
Had keeping of the church : he was of <unk> ,
And <unk> by wan <unk> away
<unk> ’ s <unk> and <unk> of <unk> . ”
He show ’ d me many others , one by one ,
And all , as they were nam ’ d , seem ’ d well content ;
For no dark gesture I discern ’ d in any .
I saw through hunger <unk> <unk>
His teeth on emptiness ; and Boniface ,
That wav ’ d the <unk> o ’ er a num ’ rous flock .
I saw the Marquis , who <unk> time erewhile
To <unk> at Forli with less drought , yet so
Was one ne ’ er sated . I howe ’ er , like him ,
That gazing ’ midst a crowd , <unk> out one ,
So <unk> him of Lucca ; for methought
Was none amongst them took such note of me .
Somewhat I heard him whisper of <unk> :
The sound was indistinct , and murmur ’ d there ,
Where justice , that so <unk> them , fix ’ d her sting .
“ Spirit ! ” said I , “ it seems as thou wouldst fain
Speak with me . Let me hear thee . <unk> wish
To converse prompts , which let us both indulge . ”
He , answ ’ ring , straight began : “ Woman is born ,
Whose brow no <unk> shades yet , that shall make
My city please thee , blame it as they may .
Go then with this <unk> . If aught false
My whisper too implied , th ’ event shall tell
But say , if of a truth I see the man
Of that new lay th ’ <unk> , which begins
With ‘ <unk> , ye that <unk> the lore of love ’ . ”
To whom I thus : “ Count of me but as one
Who am the <unk> of love ; that , when he breathes ,
Take up my pen , and , as he <unk> , write . ”
“ Brother ! ” said he , “ the hind ’ rance which once held
The <unk> with Guittone and myself ,
Short of that new and sweeter style I hear ,
Is now <unk> ’ d . I see how ye your plumes
Stretch , as th ’ <unk> guides them ; which , no question ,
<unk> did not . He that seeks a grace beyond ,
<unk> not the distance parts one style from other . ”
And , as contented , here he held his peace .
Like as the bird , that winter near the Nile ,
In <unk> regiment direct their course ,
Then stretch themselves in <unk> for speedier flight ;
Thus all the tribe of spirits , as they turn ’ d
Their visage , <unk> deaf , nimble alike
Through leanness and desire . And as a man ,
Tir ’ d With the motion of a <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> pace , and <unk> behind his company ,
Till his o ’ <unk> lungs keep <unk> time ;
E ’ en so Forese let that holy crew
<unk> , behind them lingering at my side ,
And saying : “ When shall I again behold thee ? ”
“ How long my life may last , ” said I , “ I know not ;
This know , how soon <unk> I return ,
My wishes will before me have arriv ’ d .
<unk> the place , where I am set to live ,
Is , day by day , more <unk> ’ d of all its good ,
And dismal ruin seems to threaten it . ”
“ Go now , ” he cried : “ lo ! he , whose guilt is most ,
<unk> before my vision , dragg ’ d at heels
Of an <unk> beast . Toward the vale ,
Where guilt hath no <unk> , on it <unk> ,
Each step <unk> swiftness on the last ;
Until a blow it strikes , that <unk> him
A <unk> most <unk> shatter ’ d . No long space
Those wheels have yet to roll ” ( therewith his eyes
Look ’ d up to heav ’ n ) “ ere thou shalt plainly see
That which my words may not more plainly tell .
I quit thee : time is precious here : I lose
Too much , thus <unk> my pace with shine . ”
As from a troop of <unk> ’ d <unk>
One knight , more <unk> than the rest ,
<unk> forth at <unk> , eager to display
His prowess in the first encounter prov ’ d
So parted he from us with lengthen ’ d strides ,
And left me on the way with those twain spirits ,
Who were such mighty marshals of the world .
When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
No nearer reach ’ d him , than my thought his words ,
The branches of another fruit , thick hung ,
And <unk> fresh , appear ’ d . E ’ en as our steps
Turn ’ d thither , not far off it rose to view .
Beneath it were a multitude , that rais ’ d
Their hands , and shouted forth I know not What
Unto the boughs ; like greedy and fond <unk> ,
That beg , and answer none obtain from him ,
Of whom they beg ; but more to draw them on ,
He at arm ’ s length the object of their wish
Above them holds aloft , and hides it not .
At length , as <unk> ’ d they went their way :
And we approach the tree , who vows and tears
<unk> to in vain , the mighty tree . “ Pass on ,
And come not near . Stands higher up the wood ,
Whereof Eve tasted , and from it was ta ’ en
‘ this plant . ” Such sounds from midst the thickets came .
Whence I , with either bard , close to the side
That rose , pass ’ d forth beyond . “ Remember , ” next
We heard , “ those noblest creatures of the clouds ,
How they their twofold bosoms <unk> ’ d
Oppos ’ d in fight to Theseus : call to mind
The <unk> , how <unk> they stoop ’ d
To ease their thirst ; whence <unk> ’ s ranks were <unk> ’ d ,
As he to <unk> <unk> ’ d <unk> the <unk> . ”
Thus near one border coasting , still we heard
The sins of gluttony , with woe erewhile
<unk> ’ d . Then along the lonely path ,
Once more at large , full thousand paces on
We travel ’ d , each <unk> and mute .
“ Why <unk> journey thus ye three alone ? ”
Thus suddenly a voice exclaim ’ d : whereat
I shook , as doth a <unk> ’ d and <unk> beast ;
Then rais ’ d my head to look from whence it came .
Was ne ’ er , in furnace , glass , or metal seen
So bright and glowing red , as was the shape
I now beheld . “ If ye desire to mount , ”
He cried , “ here must ye turn . This way he goes ,
Who goes in quest of peace . ” His countenance
Had dazzled me ; and to my guides I fac ’ d
Backward , like one who walks , as sound directs .
As when , to <unk> the dawn , springs up
On <unk> ’ d wing the air of May , and breathes
Of fragrance , all <unk> ’ d with herb and flowers ,
E ’ en such a wind I felt upon my front
<unk> gently , and the moving of a wing
<unk> ’ d , that moving shed <unk> smell ;
And then a voice : “ Blessed are they , whom grace
Doth so <unk> , that appetite in them
<unk> no <unk> desire ,
Still hung ’ ring as the rule of <unk> wills . ”
CANTO XXV
It was an hour , when he who climbs , had need
To walk <unk> : for the sun had now
To <unk> the meridian circle left ,
And to the <unk> left the night . As one
That makes no pause , but presses on his road ,
Whate ’ er <unk> him , if some <unk> need
<unk> : so enter ’ d we upon our way ,
One before other ; for , but singly , none
That steep and narrow scale <unk> to climb .
E ’ en as the young stork <unk> up his wing
Through wish to fly , yet <unk> not to quit
The nest , and drops it ; so in me desire
Of questioning my guide arose , and fell ,
Arriving even to the act , that marks
A man prepar ’ d for speech . Him all our haste
Restrain ’ d not , but thus spake the sire belov ’ d :
“ Fear not to speed the <unk> , that on thy lip
Stands trembling for its flight . ” <unk> ’ d thus
I straight began : “ How there can leanness come ,
Where is no want of <unk> to feed ? ”
“ If thou , ” he answer ’ d , “ hadst remember ’ d thee ,
How <unk> with the <unk> brand
<unk> alike , by equal fires consum ’ d ,
This would not <unk> thee : and hadst thou thought ,
How in the mirror your reflected form
With <unk> motion <unk> , what now seems
Hard , had appear ’ d no <unk> than the pulp
Of summer fruit mature . But that thy will
In certainty may find its full repose ,
Lo Statius here ! on him I call , and pray
That he would now be <unk> of thy wound . ”
“ If in thy presence I unfold to him
The <unk> of heaven ’ s vengeance , let me <unk>
Thine own <unk> , to exculpate me . ”
So Statius answer ’ d , and forthwith began :
“ <unk> my words , O son , and in thy mind
Receive them : so shall they be light to clear
The doubt thou offer ’ st . Blood , concocted well ,
Which by the thirsty veins is ne ’ er <unk> ’ d ,
And rests as food <unk> , to be ta ’ en
From the <unk> ’ d table , in the heart
<unk> effectual virtue , that <unk>
The several human limbs , as being that ,
Which passes through the veins itself to make them .
Yet more concocted it descends , where shame
Forbids to mention : and from thence distils
In natural vessel on another ’ s blood .
Then each <unk> together , one dispos ’ d
T ’ endure , to act the other , through meet frame
Of its <unk> mould : that being reach ’ d ,
It ’ <unk> to work , <unk> first ;
Then <unk> what its own substance caus ’ d
To bear . With <unk> now <unk> ,
The <unk> virtue ( <unk> from a plant
No further , than that this is on the way
And at its limit that ) <unk> yet
To <unk> , that now it moves , and feels ,
As sea sponge <unk> to the rock : and there
<unk> th ’ <unk> powers its seed convey ’ d .
‘ This is the <unk> , son ! at which the virtue ,
That from the <unk> heart proceeds ,
Is <unk> and <unk> ; for each limb
Is in the heart by <unk> nature <unk> ’ d .
How babe of animal becomes , remains
For thy <unk> ’ ring . At this point , more wise ,
Than thou hast err ’ d , making the soul <unk> ’ d
From <unk> intellect , because he saw
No organ for the latter ’ s use assign ’ d .
“ Open thy bosom to the truth that comes .
Know soon as in the <unk> , to the brain ,
<unk> is complete , then turns
The primal <unk> with a smile of joy
On such great work of nature , and <unk>
New spirit replete with virtue , that what here
<unk> it finds , to its own substance draws ,
And forms an individual soul , that lives ,
And feels , and bends <unk> on itself .
And that thou less mayst marvel at the word ,
Mark the sun ’ s heat , how that to wine doth change ,

“ When <unk> hath <unk> the thread , the soul
Takes with her both the human and divine ,

With each sense even to the sight endued :
Hence speech is ours , hence laughter , tears , and sighs
Which thou mayst oft have witness ’ d on the mount
Th ’ obedient shadow fails not to present
Whatever varying passion moves within us .
And this the cause of what thou marvel ’ st at . ”
Now the last flexure of our way we reach ’ d ,
And to the right hand turning , other care
<unk> us . Here the rocky precipice
Hurls forth <unk> flames , and from the rim
A blast <unk> , with <unk> <unk>

“ Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes .
A little <unk> and the way is lost . ”
Then from the bosom of the burning mass ,
“ O God of mercy ! ” heard I sung ; and felt
No less desire to turn . And when I saw
Spirits along the flame <unk> , I
Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
To share by turns my view . At the hymn ’ s close
They shouted loud , “ I do not know a man ; ”
Then in low voice again took up the strain ,
Which once more ended , “ To the wood , ” they cried ,
“ Ran Dian , and <unk> forth <unk> , stung
With Cytherea ’ s poison : ” then return ’ d
Unto their song ; then <unk> a pair <unk> ’ d ,

CANTO XXVI
While singly thus along the rim we walk ’ d ,
Oft the good master warn ’ d me : “ Look thou well .
<unk> it that I caution thee . ” The sun
Now all the western clime <unk> chang ’ d
From azure <unk> to white ; and , as I pass ’ d ,
My passing shadow made the umber ’ d flame
<unk> ruddier . At so strange a sight I mark ’ d
That many a spirit marvel ’ d on his way .
This bred <unk> first to speak of me ,
“ He seems , ” said they , “ no <unk> frame : ”
Then to obtain what certainty they might ,
Stretch ’ d towards me , careful not to overpass
The burning pale . “ O thou , who <unk>
The others , haply not more slow than they ,
But mov ’ d by rev ’ rence , answer me , who burn
In thirst and fire : nor I alone , but these
All for thine answer do more thirst , than doth
Indian or <unk> for the <unk> stream .
Tell us , how is it that thou mak ’ st thyself
A wall against the sun , as thou not yet
Into th ’ <unk> toils of death
Hadst enter ’ d ? ” Thus spake one , and I had straight
<unk> ’ d me , if attention had not turn ’ d
To new appearance . Meeting these , there came ,
Midway the burning path , a crowd , on whom
<unk> gazing , from each part I view
The shadows all press forward , sev ’ <unk>
Each snatch a hasty kiss , and then away .
E ’ en so the emmets , ’ mid their dusky troops ,
<unk> closely one at other , to spy out
Their mutual road perchance , and how they <unk> .
That <unk> greeting parted , ere dispatch
Of the first onward step , from either tribe
Loud clamour rises : those , who newly come ,
<unk> “ Sodom and <unk> ! ” these , “ The <unk>
<unk> enter ’ d , that the beast she <unk> ’ d
Might rush unto her luxury . ” Then as cranes ,
That part towards the <unk> mountains fly ,
Part towards the <unk> sands , these to <unk>
The ice , and those the sun ; so <unk> off
One crowd , advances th ’ other ; and <unk>
Their first song weeping , and their several shout .
Again drew near my side the very same ,
Who had erewhile besought me , and their looks
Mark ’ d eagerness to listen . I , who twice
Their will had noted , spake : “ O spirits secure ,
Whene ’ er the time may be , of peaceful end !
My limbs , nor crude , nor in mature old age ,
Have I left yonder : here they bear me , fed
With blood , and <unk> . That I no more
May live in blindness , hence I tend aloft .
There is a dame on high , who wind for us
This grace , by which my mortal through your realm
I bear . But may your utmost wish soon meet
Such full fruition , that the orb of heaven ,
<unk> of love , and of most ample space ,
Receive you , as ye tell ( upon my page
Henceforth to stand recorded ) who ye are ,
And what this multitude , that at your backs
Have past behind us . ” As one , <unk> ,
<unk> and <unk> , if some city ’ s walls
He chance to enter , round him <unk> <unk> ,
Confounded and struck dumb ; e ’ en such appear ’ d
Each spirit . But when rid of that amaze ,
( Not long the inmate of a noble heart )
He , who before had question ’ d , thus resum ’ d :
“ O blessed , who , for death <unk> , <unk> ’ st
Experience of our limits , in thy bark !
Their crime , who not with us proceed , was that ,
For which , as he did triumph , Caesar heard
The <unk> of ‘ queen , ’ to <unk> him . Hence their cry
Of ‘ Sodom , ’ as they parted , to rebuke
<unk> , and aid the burning by their shame .
Our sinning was <unk> : but we ,
Because the law of human kind we broke ,
Following like beasts our vile <unk> ,
Hence parting from them , to our own <unk>
Record the name of her , by whom the beast
In bestial tire was <unk> . Now our deeds
Thou know ’ st , and how we <unk> ’ d . If thou by name
<unk> haply know us , time <unk> not now
To tell so much , nor can I. Of myself
Learn what thou <unk> . <unk> I ,
Who having truly sorrow ’ d ere my last ,
Already cleanse me . ” With such pious joy ,
As the two sons upon their mother gaz ’ d
From sad <unk> <unk> ’ d , such my joy
( Save that I more <unk> it ) when I heard
From his own lips the name of him <unk> ’ d ,
Who was a father to me , and to those
My betters , who have ever us ’ d the sweet
And pleasant rhymes of love . So nought I heard
Nor spake , but long time <unk> I went ,
Gazing on him ; and , only for the fire ,
Approach ’ d not nearer . When my eyes were fed
By looking on him , with such solemn pledge ,
As forces <unk> , I <unk> me
Unto his service wholly . In reply
He thus bespake me : “ What from thee I hear
Is <unk> ’ d so deeply on my mind , the waves
Of Lethe shall not wash it off , nor make
A <unk> less lively . But as now thy oath
Has seal ’ d the truth , declare what cause <unk>
That love , which both thy looks and speech <unk> . ”
“ Those dulcet lays , ” I answer ’ d , “ which , as long
As of our tongue the beauty does not fade ,
Shall make us love the very <unk> that trac ’ d them . ”
“ Brother ! ” he cried , and pointed at a shade
Before him , “ there is one , whose mother speech
Doth <unk> to him a fairer ornament .
He in love <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
Without a <unk> stands , and lets the <unk>
<unk> on , who think the <unk> of <unk>
O ’ <unk> him . <unk> and the <unk> voice
They look to more than truth , and so confirm
Opinion , ere by art or reason taught .
Thus many of the elder time cried up
Guittone , <unk> him the prize , till truth
By strength of numbers vanquish ’ d . If thou own
So ample privilege , as to have gain ’ d
Free entrance to the cloister , whereof Christ
Is <unk> of the college , say to him
One <unk> for me , far as needs
For dwellers in this world , where power to sin
No longer <unk> us . ” Haply to make way
For one , that follow ’ d next , when that was said ,
He vanish ’ d through the fire , as through the wave
A fish , that glances <unk> to the deep .
I , to the spirit he had shown me , drew
A little onward , and besought his name ,
For which my heart , I said , kept gracious room .
He <unk> thus began : “ Thy courtesy
So wins on me , I have nor power nor will
To hide me . I am <unk> ; and with songs ,
<unk> lamenting for my folly past ,
<unk> this ford of fire I <unk> , and see
The day , I hope for , smiling in my view .
I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
Unto the summit of the scale , in time
Remember ye my suff ’ rings . ” With such words
He disappear ’ d in the <unk> flame .
CANTO <unk>
Now was the sun so station ’ d , as when first
His early radiance <unk> on the heights ,
Where stream ’ d his Maker ’ s blood , while <unk> hangs
Above <unk> <unk> , and new fires
<unk> flash on Ganges ’ yellow tide .
So day was sinking , when the ’ angel of God
Appear ’ d before us . Joy was in his mien .
Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink ,
And with a voice , whose lively <unk> far
<unk> ’ d our human , “ Blessed are the pure
In heart , ” he <unk> : then near him as we came ,
“ Go ye not further , holy spirits ! ” he cried ,
“ Ere the fire pierce you : enter in ; and list
Attentive to the song ye hear from thence . ”
I , when I heard his saying , was as one
Laid in the grave . My hands together clasp ’ d ,
And upward stretching , on the fire I look ’ d ,
And <unk> fancy conjur ’ d up the forms
Erewhile beheld alive consum ’ d in flames .
Th ’ escorting spirits turn ’ d with gentle looks
Toward me , and the Mantuan spake : “ My son ,
Here torment thou mayst feel , but canst not death .
Remember thee , remember thee , if I
Safe e ’ en on Geryon brought thee : now I come
More near to God , wilt thou not trust me now ?
Of this be sure : though in its womb that flame
A thousand years contain ’ d thee , from thy head
No hair should perish . If thou doubt my truth ,
Approach , and with thy hands thy vesture ’ s hem
Stretch forth , and for thyself confirm belief .
Lay now all fear , O lay all fear aside .
Turn hither , and come onward <unk> ’ d . ”
I still , though conscience urg ’ d ’ no step advanc ’ d .
When still he saw me fix ’ d and <unk> ,
Somewhat disturb ’ d he cried : “ Mark now , my son ,
From Beatrice thou art by this wall
Divided . ” As at <unk> ’ s name the eye
Of Pyramus was open ’ d ( when life <unk> ’ d
Fast from his veins ) , and took one parting glance ,
While vermeil dyed the mulberry ; thus I turn ’ d
To my sage guide , <unk> , when I heard
The name , that springs forever in my breast .
He shook his forehead ; and , “ How long , ” he said ,
“ Linger we now ? ” then smil ’ d , as one would smile
Upon a child , that eyes the fruit and yields .
Into the fire before me then he walk ’ d ;
And Statius , who erewhile no little space
Had parted us , he pray ’ d to come behind .
I would have cast me into <unk> glass
To <unk> me , when I enter ’ d ; so intense
<unk> ’ d the <unk> mass . The sire belov ’ d ,
To comfort me , as he proceeded , still
Of Beatrice talk ’ d . “ Her eyes , ” <unk> he ,
“ E ’ en now I seem to view . ” From the other side
A voice , that sang , did guide us , and the voice
Following , with heedful ear , we issued forth ,
There where the path led upward . “ Come , ” we heard ,
“ Come , blessed of my Father . ” Such the sounds ,
That hail ’ d us from within a light , which shone
So radiant , I could not endure the view .
“ The sun , ” it added , “ <unk> : and evening comes .
Delay not : ere the western sky is hung
With <unk> , strive ye for the pass . ” Our way
Upright within the rock arose , and fac ’ d
Such part of heav ’ n , that from before my steps
The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun .
Nor many stairs were overpass , when now
By <unk> of the shadow we perceiv ’ d
The sun behind us couch ’ d : and ere one face
Of darkness o ’ er its <unk> <unk>
<unk> ’ d th ’ horizon , and the night her lot
Held individual , each of us had made
A stair his <unk> : not that will , but power ,
Had fail ’ d us , by the nature of that mount
<unk> further travel . As the goats ,
That late have <unk> ’ d and <unk> ’ d rapidly
Upon the craggy cliffs , ere they had ta ’ en
Their <unk> on the herb , now silent lie
And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown ,
While noonday <unk> ; and the <unk> <unk>
Upon his staff , and leaning <unk> them :
And as the <unk> , that <unk> out all night
In quiet by his flock , lest beast of prey
<unk> them ; even so all three abode ,
I as a goat and as the shepherds they ,
Close pent on either side by shelving rock .
A little glimpse of sky was seen above ;
Yet by that little I beheld the stars
In <unk> and <unk> <unk> forth
With more than wonted glory . As I lay ,
Gazing on them , and in that fit of musing ,
<unk> overcame me , sleep , that <unk> oft
Tidings of future hap . <unk> the hour ,
As I believe , when <unk> from the east
First lighten ’ d on the mountain , she whose orb
Seems always glowing with the fire of love ,
A lady young and beautiful , I dream ’ d ,
Was passing o ’ er a <unk> ; and , as she came ,
Methought I saw her ever and anon
<unk> to cull the flowers ; and thus she sang :
“ Know ye , whoever of my name would ask ,
That I am <unk> : for my brow to <unk>
A garland , these fair hands unwearied ply .
To please me at the crystal mirror , here
I deck me . But my sister Rachel , she
Before her glass <unk> the <unk> day ,
Her radiant eyes beholding , charm ’ d no less ,
Than I with this delightful task . Her joy
In contemplation , as in labour mine . ”
And now as glimm ’ ring dawn appear ’ d , that breaks
More welcome to the pilgrim still , as he
<unk> less distant on his homeward way ,
<unk> from all sides fled , and with it fled
My slumber ; whence I rose and saw my guide
Already risen . “ That <unk> fruit ,
Which through so many a branch the <unk> care
Of mortals roams in quest of , shall this day
<unk> thy hunger . ” Such the words I heard
From Virgil ’ s lip ; and never greeting heard
So pleasant as the sounds . Within me straight
Desire so grew upon desire to mount ,
<unk> at each step I felt the wings
<unk> for my flight . When we had run
O ’ er all the ladder to its topmost round ,
As there we stood , on me the Mantuan fix ’ d
His eyes , and thus he spake : “ Both fires , my son ,
The <unk> and eternal , thou hast seen ,
And art arriv ’ d , where of itself my ken
No further <unk> . I with skill and art
Thus far have drawn thee . Now thy pleasure take
For guide . Thou hast o ’ ercome the steeper way ,
O ’ ercome the straighter . Lo ! the sun , that darts
His beam upon thy forehead ! lo ! the herb ,
The <unk> and flowers , which of itself
This land pours forth <unk> ! Till those bright eyes
With gladness come , which , weeping , made me haste
To succour thee , thou mayst or seat thee down ,
Or wander where thou wilt . Expect no more
<unk> of warning voice or sign from me ,
Free of thy own <unk> to choose ,
<unk> , <unk> . To distrust thy sense
Were henceforth error . I <unk> thee then
With crown and <unk> , sovereign o ’ er thyself . ”
CANTO XXVIII
Through that celestial forest , whose thick shade
With lively <unk> the <unk> day
Attemper ’ d , eager now to roam , and search
Its limits round , forthwith I left the bank ,
Along the champain leisurely my way
Pursuing , o ’ er the ground , that on all sides
<unk> odour breath ’ d . A pleasant air ,
That <unk> never , never <unk> ’ d ,
Smote on my temples , gently , as a wind
Of <unk> influence : at which the sprays ,
<unk> all , lean ’ d trembling to that part
Where first the holy mountain casts his shade ,
Yet were not so disorder ’ d , but that still
Upon their top the feather ’ d <unk>
<unk> their wonted art , and with full joy
<unk> ’ d those hours of prime , and warbled shrill
Amid the leaves , that to their <unk> lays
<unk> <unk> ; even as from branch to branch ,
Along the <unk> <unk> on the shore
Of <unk> , rolls the gath ’ ring melody ,
When <unk> hath from his cavern loos ’ d
The <unk> south . Already had my steps ,
Though slow , so far into that ancient wood
<unk> me , I could not ken the place
Where I had enter ’ d , when behold ! my path
Was <unk> by a rill , which to the left
With little <unk> waters bent the grass ,
That issued from its brink . On earth no wave
How clean soe ’ er , that would not seem to have
Some mixture in itself , compar ’ d with this ,
<unk> , clear ; yet darkly on it roll ’ d ,
<unk> beneath perpetual gloom , which ne ’ er
<unk> or sun or moon light there to shine .
My feet advanc ’ d not ; but my wond ’ ring eyes
Pass ’ d onward , o ’ er the streamlet , to survey
The tender <unk> , <unk> ’ d through many a hue ,
In <unk> <unk> : and there ,
As object , rising suddenly to view ,
That from our bosom every thought beside
With the rare marvel <unk> , I beheld
A lady all alone , who , singing , went ,
And <unk> flower from flower , wherewith her way
Was all o ’ er painted . “ Lady beautiful !
Thou , who ( if looks , that use to speak the heart ,
Are worthy of our trust ) , with love ’ s own beam
Dost warm thee , ” thus to her my speech I fram ’ d :
“ Ah ! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
Thy steps so near , that I may list thy song .
Beholding thee and this fair place , methinks ,
I call to mind where wander ’ d and how look ’ d
<unk> , in that season , when her child
The mother lost , and she the <unk> spring . ”
As when a lady , turning in the dance ,
Doth foot it <unk> , and advances scarce
One step before the other to the ground ;
Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
Thus turn ’ d she at my suit , most <unk> ,
<unk> her <unk> eyes , and came so near ,
That I <unk> caught the dulcet sound .
Arriving where the <unk> waters now
<unk> ’ d the green <unk> , her eyes she deign ’ d to raise ,
That shot such splendour on me , as I ween
Ne ’ er <unk> from Cytherea ’ s , when her son
Had sped his <unk> weapon to her heart .
Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil ’ d
through her graceful fingers shifted still
The <unk> <unk> , which without seed
That lofty land <unk> . By the stream
Three paces only were we sunder ’ d : yet
The <unk> , where <unk> pass ’ d it o ’ er ,
( A curb for ever to the pride of man )
Was by <unk> not more <unk> held
For <unk> , with <unk> wave
’ Twixt <unk> and <unk> , than by me
That flood , because it gave no passage thence .
“ <unk> ye come , and haply in this place ,
That <unk> human nature in its birth ,
Wond ’ ring , ye not without suspicion view
My smiles : but that sweet strain of psalmody ,
‘ Thou , Lord ! hast made me glad , ’ will give ye light ,
Which may <unk> your minds . And thou , who stand ’ st
The foremost , and didst make thy suit to me ,
Say if aught else thou wish to hear : for I
Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine . ”
She spake ; and I replied : “ I know not how
To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
Of forest leaves , with what I late have heard
Of opposite report . ” She answering thus :
“ I will unfold the cause , whence that proceeds ,
Which makes thee wonder ; and so purge the cloud
That hath <unk> thee . The First Good , whose joy
Is only in himself , created man
For happiness , and gave this goodly place ,
His pledge and earnest of eternal peace .
Favour ’ d thus <unk> , through his own defect
He fell , and here made short sojourn ; he fell ,
And , for the bitterness of sorrow , chang ’ d
<unk> <unk> ’ d and <unk> delight .
That vapours none , exhal ’ d from earth beneath ,
Or from the waters ( which , wherever heat
Attracts them , follow ) , might ascend thus far
To vex man ’ s peaceful state , this mountain rose
So high toward the heav ’ n , nor fears the rage
Of <unk> <unk> , from that part
Exempted , where the gate his limit bars .
Because the <unk> air throughout
With its first impulse circles still , unless
Aught <unk> to cheek or thwart its course ;
Upon the summit , which on every side
To <unk> of th ’ <unk> air
Is open , doth that motion strike , and makes
Beneath its sway th ’ <unk> wood <unk> :
And in the shaken plant such power <unk> ,
That it <unk> with its efficacy
The <unk> <unk> , upon whose subtle plume
That wafted flies abroad ; and th ’ other land
<unk> ( as ’ t is worthy in itself ,
Or in the clime , that warms it ) , doth <unk> ,
And from its womb <unk> many a tree
Of various virtue . This when thou hast heard ,
The marvel <unk> , if in yonder earth
Some plant without apparent seed be found
To fix its <unk> stem . And further learn ,
That with prolific <unk> of all seeds ,
This holy plain is fill ’ d , and in itself
Bears fruit that ne ’ er was pluck ’ d on other soil .
The water , thou behold ’ st , springs not from vein ,
As stream , that <unk> repairs
And <unk> his pulse of life , but issues forth
From fountain , solid , <unk> , sure ;
And by the will <unk> , full supply
<unk> whatsoe ’ er On either side it pours ;
On this devolv ’ d with power to take away
Remembrance of offence , on that to bring
Remembrance back of every good deed done .
From whence its name of Lethe on this part ;
On th ’ other Eunoe : both of which must first
Be tasted ere it work ; the last exceeding
All <unk> else . <unk> thy thirst may now
Be well contented , if I here break off ,
No more <unk> : yet a <unk>
I freely give beside : nor deem my words
Less grateful to thee , if they somewhat pass
The stretch of promise . They , whose verse of yore
The golden age recorded and its bliss ,
On the Parnassian mountain , of this place
Perhaps had dream ’ d . Here was man <unk> , here
Perpetual spring and every fruit , and this
The <unk> ’ d nectar . ” Turning to the bards ,
When she had ceas ’ d , I noted in their looks
A smile at her <unk> ; then my face
Again directed to the lovely dame .
CANTO XXIX
<unk> , as if enamour ’ d , she resum ’ d
And clos ’ d the song , with “ Blessed they whose sins
Are cover ’ d . ” Like the <unk> then , that <unk> ’ d
Singly across the <unk> shadows , one
Eager to view and one to ’ scape the sun ,
So mov ’ d she on , against the current , up
The verdant <unk> . I , her <unk> step
<unk> , with as tardy step pursued .
Between us not an hundred paces trod ,
The bank , on each side bending equally ,
Gave me to face the orient . Nor our way
Far onward brought us , when to me at once
She turn ’ d , and cried : “ My brother ! look and hearken . ”
And lo ! a sudden lustre ran across
Through the great forest on all parts , so bright
I <unk> whether lightning were abroad ;
But that expiring ever in the <unk> ,
That doth unfold it , and this <unk> still
And waxing still in splendor , made me question
What it might be : and a sweet melody
Ran through the luminous air . Then did I chide
With <unk> zeal the hardihood
Of our first parent , for that there were earth
Stood in <unk> to the heav ’ ns , she only ,
Woman , the creature of an hour , endur ’ d not
<unk> of any veil : which had she borne
<unk> , <unk> , ineffable as these ,
Had from the first , and long time since , been mine .
While through that wilderness of <unk> <unk>
That never fade , suspense I walk ’ d , and yet
<unk> of <unk> more high ,
Before us , like a blazing fire , the air
Under the green boughs glow ’ d ; and , for a song ,
Distinct the sound of melody was heard .
O ye thrice holy virgins ! for your sakes
If e ’ er I suffer ’ d hunger , cold and watching ,
<unk> calls on me to crave your bounty .
Now through my breast let <unk> his stream
Pour copious ; and <unk> with her choir
Arise to aid me : while the verse unfolds
Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought .
Onward a space , what seem ’ d seven <unk> of gold ,
The intervening distance to mine eye
<unk> <unk> ; but when I was come
So near them , that no <unk> was lost
Of those , with which a doubtful object , seen
<unk> , <unk> on the <unk> sense ,
Then did the faculty , that ministers
Discourse to reason , these for <unk> of gold
<unk> , and it th ’ singing trace the sound
“ <unk> . ” Above , their beauteous <unk>
<unk> ’ d with more ample lustre , than the moon
Through <unk> sky at midnight in her full .
I turn ’ d me full of wonder to my guide ;
And he did answer with a countenance
<unk> ’ d with no less amazement : whence my view
<unk> to those lofty things , which came
So slowly moving towards us , that the bride
Would have <unk> them on her <unk> day .
The lady called aloud : “ Why thus yet burns
Affection in thee for these living , lights ,
And dost not look on that which follows them ? ”
I straightway mark ’ d a tribe behind them walk ,
As if <unk> on their <unk> , cloth ’ d
With raiment of such whiteness , as on earth
Was never . On my left , the wat ’ ry gleam
Borrow ’ d , and gave me back , when there I look ’ d .
As in a mirror , my left side <unk> ’ d .
When I had chosen on the river ’ s edge
Such station , that the distance of the stream
Alone did separate me ; there I stay ’ d
My steps for clearer <unk> , and beheld
The flames go onward , <unk> , as they went ,
The air behind them painted as with trail
Of <unk> <unk> ! so distinct were mark ’ d
All those sev ’ n listed colours , whence the sun
<unk> his bow , and <unk> her <unk> .
These streaming <unk> did flow beyond
My vision ; and ten paces , as I guess ,
Parted the <unk> . Beneath a sky
So beautiful , came foul <unk> elders ,
By two and two , with <unk> crown ’ d .
All sang one song : “ Blessed be thou among
The <unk> of Adam ! and thy loveliness
Blessed for ever ! ” After that the flowers ,
And the fresh <unk> , on the opposite brink ,
Were free from that <unk> race ; as light
In heav ’ n doth second light , came after them
Four animals , each crown ’ d with <unk> leaf .
With six wings each was plum ’ d , the <unk> full
Of eyes , and th ’ eyes of <unk> would be such ,
Were they endued with life . Reader , more rhymes
Will not waste in <unk> forth their form :
For other need no <unk> , that in this
I may not give my bounty room . But read
<unk> ; for he paints them , from the north
How he beheld them come by <unk> ’ s flood ,
In whirlwind , cloud and fire ; and even such
As thou shalt find them <unk> ’ d by him ,
Here were they ; save as to the pennons ; there ,
From him departing , John accords with me .
The space , <unk> by the four , enclos ’ d
A car <unk> : on two wheels it came
Drawn at a Gryphon ’ s neck ; and he above
Stretch ’ d either wing uplifted , ’ <unk> the midst
And the three listed hues , on each side three ;
So that the wings did cleave or <unk> none ;
And out of sight they rose . The members , far
As he was bird , were golden ; white the rest
With vermeil <unk> ’ d . So beautiful
A car in Rome ne ’ er grac ’ d Augustus <unk> ,
Or <unk> ’ : e ’ en the sun ’ s itself
Were poor to this , that chariot of the sun
Erroneous , which in blazing ruin fell
At <unk> ’ pray ’ r devout , by the just doom
Mysterious of <unk> Jove . Three nymphs
at the right wheel , came circling in smooth dance ;
The one so ruddy , that her form had scarce
Been known within a furnace of clear flame :
The next did look , as if the flesh and bones
Were <unk> : snow <unk> seem ’ d the third .
Now seem ’ d the white to lead , the ruddy now ;
And from her song who led , the others took
Their treasure , swift or slow . At th ’ other wheel ,
A band <unk> , each in <unk> clad ,
Advanc ’ d with <unk> step , as of them one
The rest conducted , one , upon whose front
Three eyes were seen . In rear of all this group ,
Two old men I beheld , <unk>
In raiment , but in port and gesture like ,
<unk> and mainly grave ; of whom the one
Did show himself some favour ’ d <unk>
Of the great <unk> , him , whom nature made
To serve the <unk> creature of her tribe .
His fellow mark ’ d an opposite intent ,
<unk> a sword , whose <unk> and keen edge ,
E ’ en as I view ’ d it with the flood between ,
<unk> ’ d me . Next four others I beheld ,
Of humble seeming : and , behind them all ,
One single old man , sleeping , as he came ,
With a <unk> visage . And these seven , each
Like the first troop were <unk> , but wore
No <unk> of lilies on their temples wreath ’ d .
Rather with <unk> and each vermeil flower ,
A sight , but little distant , might have sworn ,
That they were all on fire above their brow .
Whenas the car was o ’ er against me , straight .
Was heard a thund ’ ring , at whose voice it seem ’ d
The chosen multitude were stay ’ d ; for there ,
With the first <unk> , made they solemn <unk> .
CANTO XXX
Soon as the <unk> light , which never knows
<unk> nor rising , nor the shadowy veil
Of other cloud than sin , fair ornament
Of the first heav ’ n , to duty each one there
<unk> <unk> , as that lower doth
The steersman to his port , stood firmly fix ’ d ;
Forthwith the saintly tribe , who in the <unk>
Between the Gryphon and its radiance came ,
Did turn them to the car , as to their rest :
And one , as if <unk> ’ d from above ,
In holy chant thrice <unk> forth aloud :
“ Come , spouse , from <unk> ! ” and all the rest
<unk> up the song — At the last <unk> so
The blest shall rise , from forth his cavern each
<unk> lightly his <unk> flesh ,
As , on the sacred litter , at the voice
<unk> of that elder , sprang
A hundred ministers and messengers
Of life eternal . “ Blessed thou ! who com ’ st ! ”
And , “ O , ” they cried , “ from full hands scatter ye
<unk> ’ ring lilies ; ” and , so saying , cast
<unk> over head and round them on all sides .
I have beheld , ere now , at break of day ,
The eastern clime all <unk> , and the sky
Oppos ’ d , one deep and beautiful serene ,
And the sun ’ s face so shaded , and with mists
Attemper ’ d at lids rising , that the eye
Long while endur ’ d the sight : thus in a cloud
Of flowers , that from those hands angelic rose ,
And down , within and outside of the car ,
Fell showering , in white veil with olive wreath ’ d ,
A virgin in my view appear ’ d , beneath
Green mantle , rob ’ d in hue of living flame :
And o ’ er my Spirit , that in former days
Within her presence had abode so long ,
No <unk> ’ ring terror crept . Mine eyes no more
Had knowledge of her ; yet there mov ’ d from her
A hidden virtue , at whose touch <unk> ’ d ,
The power of ancient love was strong within me .
No sooner on my vision streaming , smote
The heav ’ nly influence , which years past , and e ’ en
In <unk> , thrill ’ d me , than towards Virgil I
Turn ’ d me to leftward , panting , like a babe ,
That <unk> for <unk> to his mother ’ s breast ,
If aught have terrified or work ’ d him woe :
And would have cried : “ There is no <unk> of blood ,
That doth not quiver in me . The old flame
<unk> out clear tokens of reviving fire : ”
But Virgil had bereav ’ d us of himself ,
Virgil , my <unk> ’ d father ; Virgil , he
To whom I gave me up for safety : nor ,
All , our prime mother lost , avail ’ d to save
My <unk> ’ d cheeks from <unk> of <unk> tears .
“ Dante , weep not , that Virgil leaves thee : <unk> ,
<unk> thou not yet : behooves thee feel the edge
Of other sword , and thou shalt weep for that . ”
As to the prow or stern , some <unk>
<unk> the deck , <unk> his crew ,
When ’ mid the <unk> all hands ply aloof ;
Thus on the left side of the car I saw ,
( Turning me at the sound of mine own name ,
Which here I am compell ’ d to <unk> )
The virgin station ’ d , who before <unk>
<unk> ’ d in that festive shower angelical .
Towards me , across the stream , she bent her eyes ;
Though from her brow the veil descending , bound
With foliage of Minerva , suffer ’ d not
That I beheld her clearly ; then with act
Full <unk> , still <unk> o ’ er her thrall ,
<unk> , as one , who speaking <unk> back
The <unk> saying , to conclude the speech :
“ Observe me well . I am , in <unk> , I am
Beatrice . What ! and hast thou deign ’ d at last
Approach the mountain ? <unk> not , O man !
Thy happiness is whole ? ” Down fell mine eyes
On the clear fount , but there , myself <unk> ,
<unk> ’ d , and sought the <unk> : such a weight
Of shame was on my forehead . With a mien
Of that stern <unk> , which doth <unk>
mother ’ s presence to her <unk> child ,
She look ’ d ; a flavour of such bitterness
Was mingled in her pity . There her words
<unk> off , and suddenly the angels sang :
“ In thee , O gracious Lord , my hope hath been : ”
But went no farther than , “ Thou Lord , hast set
My feet in ample room . ” As snow , that lies
Amidst the living <unk> on the back
Of Italy congeal ’ d when <unk> high
And closely pil ’ d by rough <unk> blasts ,
<unk> but the land whereon no shadow falls ,
And straightway <unk> it distils away ,
Like a <unk> <unk> : thus was I ,
Without a sigh or tear , or ever these
Did sing , that with the <unk> of heav ’ n ’ s sphere ,
Still in their warbling <unk> : but when the strain
Of dulcet <unk> , express ’ d for me
Their soft compassion , more than could the words
“ Virgin , why so consum ’ st him ? ” then the ice ,
<unk> ’ d about my bosom , turn ’ d itself
To spirit and water , and with anguish forth
<unk> ’ d through the lips and <unk> from the heart .
Upon the chariot ’ s right edge still she stood ,
<unk> , and thus address ’ d her words
To those bright semblances with pity touch ’ d :
“ Ye in th ’ eternal day your <unk> keep ,
So that nor night nor slumber , with close <unk> ,
<unk> from you a single step in all
The <unk> on of life : thence with more heed
I shape mine answer , for his ear <unk> ,
Who there stands weeping , that the sorrow now
May equal the transgression . Not alone
Through <unk> of the mighty orbs ,
That mark each seed to some <unk> ’ d aim ,
As with aspect or fortunate or ill
The <unk> meet , but through benign
<unk> of heav ’ nly <unk> , which rain down
From such a height , as mocks our vision , this man
Was in the <unk> of his being , such ,
So <unk> <unk> , that in him
All better <unk> wond ’ <unk> had <unk> ’ d .
The more of kindly strength is in the soil ,
So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
<unk> it the more , and make it run to <unk> .
These looks <unk> upheld him ; for I show ’ d
My youthful eyes , and led him by their light
In upright walking . Soon as I had reach ’ d
The threshold of my second age , and chang ’ d
My mortal for immortal , then he left me ,
And gave himself to others . When from flesh
To spirit I had risen , and increase
Of beauty and of virtue circled me ,
I was less dear to him , and <unk> less .
His steps were turn ’ d into deceitful ways ,
Following false images of good , that make
No promise perfect . Nor avail ’ d me aught
To <unk> for <unk> , with the which ,
I , both in dreams of night , and otherwise ,
Did call him back ; of them so little <unk> ’ d him ,
Such depth he fell , that all device was short
Of his <unk> , save that he should view
The children of <unk> . To this end
I visited the purlieus of the dead :
And one , who hath conducted him thus high ,
Receiv ’ d my <unk> urg ’ d with weeping .
It were a <unk> of God ’ s high decree ,
If Lethe should be past , and such food tasted
Without the cost of some repentant tear . ”
CANTO XXXI
“ O Thou ! ” her words she thus without delay
<unk> , turn ’ d their point on me , to whom
They but with <unk> edge seem ’ d <unk> before ,
“ Say thou , who stand ’ st beyond the holy stream ,
If this be true . A charge so grievous needs
Thine own <unk> . ” On my faculty
Such strange amazement hung , the voice expir ’ d
<unk> , ere its organs gave it birth .
A little space <unk> , then she spake :
“ What dost thou muse on ? Answer me . The wave
On thy <unk> of evil yet
Hath done no injury . ” A mingled sense
Of fear and of confusion , from my lips
Did such a “ Yea ” produce , as needed help
Of vision to interpret . As when breaks
In act to be discharg ’ d , a <unk> bent
Beyond its pitch , both nerve and bow o ’ <unk> ’ d ,
The <unk> weapon <unk> <unk> the mark ;
Thus , tears and sighs forth <unk> , did I burst
Beneath the heavy load , and thus my voice
Was slacken ’ d on its way . She straight began :
“ When my desire invited thee to love
The good , which sets a bound to our <unk> ,
What bar of <unk> foss or <unk> chain
Did meet thee , that thou so should ’ st quit the hope
Of further progress , or what <unk> of ease
Or promise of allurement led thee on
<unk> , that thou elsewhere should ’ st rather wait ? ”
A bitter sigh I drew , then scarce found voice
To answer , <unk> to these sounds my lips
Gave utterance , wailing : “ Thy fair looks withdrawn ,
Things present , with deceitful pleasures , turn ’ d
My steps aside . ” She answering spake : “ Hadst thou
Been silent , or denied what thou <unk> ’ st ,
Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more : such eye
<unk> it . But whene ’ er the sinner ’ s cheek
<unk> forth into the <unk> tears
Of <unk> , in our court the wheel
Of justice doth run <unk> to the edge .
<unk> ’ er that thou may ’ st profit by thy shame
For <unk> past , and that henceforth more strength
May arm thee , when thou hear ’ st the <unk> ,
Lay thou aside the motive to this grief ,
And lend attentive ear , while I unfold
How opposite a way my buried flesh
Should have impell ’ d thee . Never didst thou spy
In art or nature aught so passing sweet ,
As were the limbs , that in their beauteous frame
<unk> ’ d me , and are scatter ’ d now in dust .
If <unk> thing thus fail ’ d thee with my death ,
What , afterward , of mortal should thy wish
Have <unk> ? When thou first hadst felt the dart
Of <unk> things , in my departing
For better realms , thy wing thou should ’ st have prun ’ d
To follow me , and never stoop ’ d again
To ’ bide a second blow for a slight <unk> ,
Or other <unk> as <unk> and as vain .
The new and inexperienc ’ d bird awaits ,
<unk> it may be , or thrice , the <unk> ’ s aim ;
But in the sight of one , whose plumes are full ,
In vain the net is spread , the arrow wing ’ d . ”
I stood , as children silent and <unk> ’ d
Stand , list ’ ning , with their eyes upon the earth ,
<unk> their fault and <unk> ’ d .
And she resum ’ d : “ If , but to hear thus pains thee ,
Raise thou thy beard , and lo ! what sight shall do ! ”
With less <unk> yields a <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> from its <unk> by a blast , that blows
From off the pole , or from <unk> ’ land ,
Than I at her behest my visage rais ’ d :
And thus the face <unk> by the beard ,
I mark ’ d the secret sting her words convey ’ d .
No sooner lifted I mine aspect up ,
Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
Of goodly creatures vanish ; and mine eyes
Yet <unk> ’ d and <unk> , bent their light
On Beatrice . Towards the animal ,
Who joins two natures in one form , she turn ’ d ,
And , even under shadow of her veil ,
And parted by the verdant rill , that flow ’ d
Between , in loveliness appear ’ d as much
Her former self <unk> , as on earth
All others she surpass ’ d . <unk> goads
<unk> sudden through me . Each thing else , the more
Its love had late beguil ’ d me , now the more
I Was loathsome . On my heart so keenly smote
The bitter <unk> , that on the ground
O ’ erpower ’ d I fell : and what my state was then ,
She knows who was the cause . When now my strength
<unk> ’ d back , returning outward from the heart ,
The lady , whom alone I first had seen ,
I found above me . “ Loose me not , ” she cried :
“ Loose not thy hold ; ” and lo ! had dragg ’ d me high
As to my neck into the stream , while she ,
Still as she drew me after , <unk> along ,
Swift as a shuttle , bounding o ’ er the wave .
The blessed shore approaching then was heard
So <unk> , “ <unk> <unk> me , ” that I
May not remember , much less tell the sound .
The beauteous dame , her arms <unk> , clasp ’ d
My temples , and <unk> ’ d me , where ’ t was fit
The wave should drench me : and thence raising up ,
Within the <unk> dance of lovely nymphs
Presented me so <unk> ’ d , and with their arm
They each did cover me . “ Here are we nymphs ,
And in the heav ’ n are stars . Or ever earth
Was visited of Beatrice , we
Appointed for her handmaids , tended on her .
We to her eyes will lead thee ; but the light
Of gladness that is in them , well to scan ,
Those yonder three , of deeper ken than ours ,
Thy sight shall quicken . ” Thus began their song ;
And then they led me to the Gryphon ’ s breast ,
While , turn ’ d toward us , Beatrice stood .
“ <unk> not thy vision . We have <unk> thee
Before the emeralds , whence love erewhile
Hath drawn his weapons on thee . ” As they spake ,
A thousand <unk> wishes riveted
Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes , that stood
Still fix ’ d toward the Gryphon motionless .
As the sun strikes a mirror , even thus
Within those orbs the twofold being , shone ,
For ever varying , in one figure now
Reflected , now in other . Reader ! muse
How wond ’ rous in my sight it seem ’ d to mark
A thing , <unk> steadfast in itself ,
Yet in its imag ’ d semblance <unk> .
Full of amaze , and joyous , while my soul
Fed on the <unk> , whereof still desire
<unk> with satiety , the other three
With gesture , that declar ’ d a loftier line ,
Advanc ’ d : to their own <unk> on they came
<unk> in festive ring angelical .
“ Turn , Beatrice ! ” was their song : “ O turn
Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one ,
Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
Hath measur ’ d . <unk> at our pray ’ r vouchsafe
<unk> to him thy cheeks : that he may mark
Thy second beauty , now conceal ’ d . ” O splendour !
O sacred light eternal ! who is he
So pale with musing in Pierian shades ,
Or with that fount so lavishly <unk> ,
Whose spirit should not fail him in th ’ essay
To represent thee such as thou didst seem ,
When under cope of the <unk> heaven
Thou gav ’ st to open air thy charms reveal ’ d .
CANTO XXXII
Mine eyes with such an eager <unk> ,
Were bent to rid them of their ten years ’ thirst ,
No other sense was <unk> : and e ’ en they
Were fenc ’ d on either side from heed of aught ;
So tangled in its custom ’ d toils that smile
Of saintly brightness drew me to itself ,
When forcibly toward the left my sight
The sacred virgins turn ’ d ; for from their lips
I heard the warning sounds : “ Too fix ’ d a gaze ! ”
<unk> my vision <unk> ’ d ; as when late
Upon the ’ o ’ <unk> eyes the sun hath smote :
But soon to lesser object , as the view
Was now <unk> ’ d ( lesser in respect
To that excess of sensible , whence late
I had perforce been sunder ’ d ) on their right
I mark ’ d that glorious <unk> wheel , and turn ,
Against the sun and sev ’ nfold lights , their front .
As when , their <unk> for <unk> rais ’ d ,
A <unk> ’ d troop , with <unk> banners curl ’ d ,
Wheel circling , ere the whole can change their ground :
E ’ en thus the goodly regiment of heav ’ n
<unk> , all did pass us , ere the car
Had slop ’ d his beam . <unk> at the wheels
The <unk> turn ’ d ; and on the Gryphon mov ’ d
The sacred burden , with a pace so smooth ,
No feather on him trembled . The fair dame
Who through the wave had drawn me , <unk>
By Statius and myself , pursued the wheel ,
Whose orbit , rolling , mark ’ d a lesser arch .
Through the high wood , now void ( the more her blame ,
Who by the serpent was beguil ’ d ) I past
With step in <unk> to the harmony
<unk> . Onward had we mov ’ d , as far
Perchance as arrow at three several <unk>
Full wing ’ d had sped , when from her station down
Descended Beatrice . With one voice
All murmur ’ d “ Adam , ” circling next a plant
<unk> ’ d of flowers and leaf on every bough .
Its tresses , <unk> more as more they rose ,
Were such , as ’ midst their forest wilds for height
The <unk> might have gaz ’ d at . “ Blessed thou !
Gryphon , whose beak hath never pluck ’ d that tree
Pleasant to taste : for hence the appetite
Was warp ’ d to evil . ” Round the stately trunk
Thus shouted forth the rest , to whom return ’ d
The animal <unk> ’ d : “ Yea : for so
The <unk> of the just are sav ’ d . ”
And turning to the <unk> , to foot
He drew it of the widow ’ d branch , and bound
There left unto the stock whereon it grew .
As when large floods of radiance from above
Stream , with that radiance mingled , which ascends
Next after setting of the scaly sign ,
Our plants then <unk> , and each wears anew
His wonted colours , ere the sun have <unk> ’ d
Beneath another star his <unk> steeds ;
Thus <unk> forth a hue , more faint than rose ,
And deeper than the <unk> , was renew ’ d
The plant , erewhile in all its branches bare .
<unk> was the hymn , which then arose .
I understood it not , nor to the end
Endur ’ d the harmony . Had I the skill
To pencil forth , how clos ’ d th ’ <unk> eyes
<unk> ’ ring , when <unk> warbled , ( eyes that paid
So dearly for their watching , ) then like <unk> ,
That with a model paints , I might design
The manner of my falling into sleep .
But feign who will the slumber <unk> ;
I pass it by to when I wak ’ d , and tell
How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
The curtain of my sleep , and one cries out :
“ Arise , what dost thou ? ” As the chosen three ,
On <unk> ’ s mount , <unk> to behold
The <unk> of that fair tree , whose fruit
Is coveted of angels , and doth make
Perpetual feast in heaven , to themselves
Returning at the word , whence deeper sleeps
Were broken , that they their tribe diminish ’ d saw ,
Both Moses and Elias gone , and chang ’ d
The stole their master wore : thus to myself
Returning , over me beheld I stand
The piteous one , who cross the stream had brought
My steps . “ And where , ” all <unk> , I exclaim ’ d ,
“ Is Beatrice ? ” — “ See her , ” she replied ,
“ Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root .
Behold th ’ associate choir that circles her .
The others , with a melody more sweet
And more profound , journeying to higher realms ,
Upon the Gryphon tend . ” If there her words
Were clos ’ d , I know not ; but mine eyes had now
Ta ’ en view of her , by whom all other thoughts
Were <unk> ’ d admittance . On the very ground
Alone she sat , as she had there been left
A guard upon the wain , which I beheld
Bound to the <unk> beast . The seven nymphs
Did make themselves a cloister round about her ,
And in their hands upheld those lights secure
From blast <unk> and the <unk> south .
“ A little while thou shalt be <unk> here :
And citizen shalt be forever with me ,
Of that true Rome , wherein Christ dwells a Roman
To profit the misguided world , keep now
Thine eyes upon the car ; and what thou seest ,
Take heed thou write , returning to that place . ”
Thus Beatrice : at whose feet <unk> ’ d
<unk> , at her behest , my thought and eyes ,
I , as she bade , directed . Never fire ,
With so swift motion , forth a stormy cloud
<unk> ’ d downward from the <unk> ’ s farthest bound ,
As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
<unk> on the tree , and , as he rush ’ d , the rind ,
<unk> crush beneath him , <unk> much more
And <unk> . On the car with all his might
He struck , whence , <unk> like a ship , it <unk> ’ d ,
At random driv ’ n , to <unk> now , o ’ ercome ,
And now to <unk> , by the <unk> waves .
Next springing up into the chariot ’ s womb
A fox I saw , with hunger seeming pin ’ d
Of all good food . But , for his ugly sins
The saintly <unk> <unk> him , away
<unk> ’ ring he turn ’ d , fast as his <unk> corpse
Would bear him . Next , from whence before he came ,
I saw the eagle dart into the <unk>
O ’ th ’ car , and leave it with his feathers <unk> ’ d ;
And then a voice , like that which issues forth
From heart with sorrow <unk> ’ d , did issue forth
From heav ’ n , and , “ O poor bark of mine ! ” it cried ,
“ How <unk> art thou freighted ! ” Then , it seem ’ d ,
That the earth open ’ d between either wheel ,
And I beheld a dragon issue thence ,
That through the chariot fix ’ d his forked train ;
And like a <unk> that <unk> back the sting ,
So drawing forth his <unk> train , he dragg ’ d
Part of the bottom forth , and went his way
<unk> . What remain ’ d , as lively <unk>
With green herb , so did <unk> itself with plumes ,
Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
Been offer ’ d ; and therewith were cloth ’ d the wheels ,
Both one and other , and the beam , so quickly
A sigh were not breath ’ d sooner . Thus transform ’ d ,
The holy structure , through its several parts ,
Did put forth heads , three on the beam , and one
On every side ; the first like oxen horn ’ d ,
But with a single horn upon their front
The four . Like monster sight hath never seen .
O ’ er it methought there sat , secure as rock
On mountain ’ s lofty top , a shameless <unk> ,
Whose ken rov ’ d <unk> round her . At her side ,
As ’ t were that none might bear her off , I saw
A giant stand ; and ever , and anon
They mingled <unk> . But , her lustful eyes
<unk> on me to wander , that fell <unk>
<unk> ’ d her from head to foot all o ’ er ; then full
Of <unk> , and fierce with rage , <unk> ’ d
The monster , and dragg ’ d on , so far across
The forest , that from me its shades alone
<unk> the harlot and the <unk> ’ d brute .
CANTO XXXIII
“ The <unk> , Lord ! are come ! ” responsive thus ,
The trinal now , and now the virgin band
<unk> , their sweet psalmody began ,
Weeping ; and Beatrice listen ’ d , sad
And sighing , to the song ’ , in such a mood ,
That Mary , as she stood beside the cross ,
Was scarce more chang ’ d . But when they gave her place
To speak , then , risen upright on her feet ,
She , with a colour glowing bright as fire ,
Did answer : “ Yet a little while , and ye
Shall see me not ; and , my beloved sisters ,
Again a little while , and ye shall see me . ”
Before her then she <unk> ’ d all the seven ,
And , beck ’ ning only motion ’ d me , the dame ,
And that remaining sage , to follow her .
So on she pass ’ d ; and had not set , I ween ,
Her tenth step to the ground , when with mine eyes
Her eyes encounter ’ d ; and , with visage mild ,
“ So mend thy pace , ” she cried , “ that if my words
Address thee , thou mayst still be aptly plac ’ d
To hear them . ” Soon as duly to her side
I now had hasten ’ d : “ Brother ! ” she began ,
“ Why mak ’ st thou no attempt at questioning ,
As thus we walk together ? ” Like to those
Who , speaking with too reverent an awe
Before their betters , draw not forth the voice
Alive unto their lips , befell me <unk>
That I in sounds imperfect thus began :
“ Lady ! what I have need of , that thou know ’ st ,
And what will suit my need . ” She answering thus :
“ Of <unk> and shame , I will , that thou
Henceforth do rid thee : that thou speak no more ,
As one who dreams . Thus far be taught of me :
The vessel , which thou saw ’ st the serpent break ,
Was and is not : let him , who hath the blame ,
<unk> not to scare God ’ s vengeance with a <unk> .
Without an heir for ever shall not be
That eagle , he , who left the chariot plum ’ d ,
Which monster made it first and next a prey .
Plainly I view , and therefore speak , the stars
E ’ en now approaching , whose <unk> , free
From all impediment and bar , brings on
A season , in the which , one sent from God ,
( Five hundred , five , and ten , do mark him out )
That foul one , and th ’ <unk> of her guilt ,
The giant , both shall slay . And if perchance
My saying , dark as <unk> or as <unk> ,
Fail to persuade thee , ( since like them it <unk>
The intellect with blindness ) yet ere long
<unk> shall be the <unk> , that will solve
This <unk> <unk> , and no <unk> light
On flock or field . Take heed ; and as these words
By me are utter ’ d , teach them even so
To those who live that life , which is a race
To death : and when thou writ ’ st them , keep in mind
Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant ,
That twice hath now been spoil ’ d . This whoso <unk> ,
This whoso <unk> , with <unk> of deed
<unk> against God , who for his use alone
<unk> hallow ’ d it . For taste of this ,
In pain and in desire , five thousand years
And upward , the first soul did yearn for him ,
Who punish ’ d in himself the fatal gust .
“ Thy reason slumbers , if it deem this height
And summit thus <unk> of the plant ,
Without due cause : and were not <unk> thoughts ,
As <unk> ’ s numbing waters , to thy soul ,
And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
As Pyramus the mulberry , thou hadst seen ,
In such <unk> <unk> alone ,
God ’ s equal justice <unk> implied
In the forbidden tree . But since I mark thee
In <unk> harden ’ d into stone ,
And , to that <unk> , <unk> too and stain ’ d ,
So that thine eye is dazzled at my word ,
I will , that , if not written , yet at least
<unk> thou take it in thee , for the cause ,
That one brings home his staff <unk> ’ d with <unk> .
I thus : “ As wax by seal , that changeth not
Its impress , now is stamp ’ d my brain by thee .
But wherefore soars thy wish ’ <unk> speech so high
Beyond my sight , that loses it the more ,
The more it strains to reach it ? ” — “ To the end
That thou mayst know , ” she answer ’ d straight , “ the school ,
That thou hast follow ’ d ; and how far behind ,
When following my discourse , its learning <unk> :
And mayst behold your art , from the divine
As distant , as the <unk> is
’ Twixt earth and heaven ’ s most high and <unk> orb . ”
“ I not remember , ” I replied , “ that e ’ er
I was <unk> ’ d from thee , nor for such fault
Doth conscience chide me . ” <unk> she return ’ d :
“ If thou canst , not remember , call to mind
How lately thou hast <unk> of Lethe ’ s wave ;
And , sure as smoke doth <unk> a flame ,
In that <unk> itself conclude
<unk> from thy <unk> will incurr ’ d .
From henceforth <unk> my words shall be
As naked as will suit them to appear
In thy <unk> ’ d view . ” More <unk> now ,
And with retarded course the sun possess ’ d
The circle of <unk> , that varies still
As th ’ aspect varies of each several clime ,
When , as one , sent in <unk> of a troop
For escort , <unk> , if perchance he spy
<unk> of somewhat strange and rare : so paus ’ d
The sev ’ nfold band , arriving at the verge
Of a dun umbrage <unk> , such as is seen ,
Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches , oft
To <unk> a <unk> and <unk> cliff .
And , where they stood , before them , as it seem ’ d ,
<unk> and <unk> both beheld ,
Forth from one fountain issue ; and , like friends ,
Linger at parting . “ O <unk> ’ ning beam !
O glory of our kind ! beseech thee say
What water this , which from one source deriv ’ d
<unk> <unk> to distance from itself ? ”
To such entreaty answer thus was made :
“ Entreat <unk> , that she teach thee this . ”
And here , as one , who <unk> himself of blame
<unk> , the fair dame return ’ d : “ Of me
He this and more hath learnt ; and I am safe
That Lethe ’ s water hath not hid it from him . ”
And Beatrice : “ Some more <unk> care
That oft the memory ’ <unk> , perchance hath made
His mind ’ s eye dark . But lo ! where Eunoe cows !
Lead thither ; and , as thou art wont , revive
His fainting virtue . ” As a courteous spirit ,
That <unk> no <unk> , but as soon
As he hath token of another ’ s will ,
Makes it his own ; when she had ta ’ en me , thus
The lovely maiden mov ’ d her on , and call ’ d
To Statius with an air most <unk> :
“ Come thou with him . ” Were further space allow ’ d ,
Then , Reader , might I sing , though but in part ,
That beverage , with whose sweetness I had ne ’ er
Been sated . But , since all the leaves are full ,
Appointed for this second strain , mine art
With warning bridle <unk> me . I return ’ d
From the most holy wave , <unk> ,
If ’ en as new plants renew ’ d with foliage new ,

That memory cannot follow . <unk> all ,
That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
Could store , shall now be matter of my song .
Benign Apollo ! this last labour aid ,
And make me such a vessel of thy worth ,
As thy own laurel <unk> of me belov ’ d .
Thus far hath one of steep <unk> ’ brows
Suffic ’ d me ; henceforth there is need of both
For my remaining enterprise Do thou
Enter into my bosom , and there breathe
So , as when <unk> by thy hand was dragg ’ d
Forth from his limbs <unk> ’ d . O power divine !
If thou to me of shine impart so much ,
That of that happy realm the shadow ’ d form
Trac ’ d in my thoughts I may set forth to view ,
Thou shalt behold me of thy favour ’ d tree
Come to the foot , and crown myself with leaves ;
For to that honour thou , and my high theme
Will fit me . If but seldom , mighty Sire !
To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath
Caesar or bard ( more shame for human wills
<unk> ’ d ) joy to the <unk> god must spring
From the Pierian foliage , when one breast
Is with such thirst inspir ’ d . From a small spark
Great flame hath risen : after me perchance
Others with better voice may pray , and gain
From the <unk> city answer kind .
Through <unk> passages , the world ’ s bright lamp
Rises to mortals , but through that which joins
Four circles with the threefold cross , in best
<unk> , and in <unk> <unk> set
He comes , and to the worldly wax best gives
Its temper and impression . <unk> there ,
Here eve was by almost such passage made ;
And whiteness had o ’ erspread that hemisphere ,
<unk> the other part ; when to the left
I saw Beatrice turn ’ d , and on the sun
Gazing , as never eagle fix ’ d his ken .
As from the first a second beam is wont
To issue , and reflected upwards rise ,
E ’ en as a pilgrim bent on his return ,
So of her act , that through the eyesight pass ’ d
Into my fancy , mine was form ’ d ; and straight ,
Beyond our mortal wont , I fix ’ d mine eyes
Upon the sun . Much is <unk> us there ,
That here <unk> our pow ’ r ; thanks to the place
Made for the dwelling of the human kind
I suffer ’ d it not long , and yet so long
That I beheld it <unk> ’ ring sparks around ,
As iron that comes boiling from the fire .
And suddenly upon the day appear ’ d
A day <unk> ’ n , as he , who hath the power ,
Had with another sun <unk> ’ d the sky .
Her eyes fast fix ’ d on the eternal wheels ,
Beatrice stood unmov ’ d ; and I with ken
Fix ’ d upon her , from upward gaze remov ’ d
At her aspect , such inwardly became
As <unk> , when he tasted of the herb ,
That made him peer among the ocean gods ;
<unk> may not tell of that <unk> change :
And therefore let the <unk> serve , though <unk> ,
For those whom grace hath better proof in store
If I were only what thou didst create ,
Then newly , Love ! by whom the heav ’ n is rul ’ d ,
Thou know ’ st , who by thy light didst bear me up .
Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide ,
<unk> Spirit ! with its harmony
<unk> ’ d of thee and measur ’ d , charm ’ d mine ear ,
Then seem ’ d to me so much of heav ’ n to <unk>
With the sun ’ s flame , that rain or flood ne ’ er made
A lake so broad . The <unk> of the sound ,
And that great light , inflam ’ d me with desire ,
<unk> than e ’ er was felt , to know their cause .
Whence she who saw me , clearly as myself ,
To calm my troubled mind , before I ask ’ d ,
Open ’ d her lips , and gracious thus began :
“ With false imagination thou thyself
<unk> ’ st dull , so that thou seest not the thing ,
Which thou hadst seen , had that been shaken off .
Thou art not on the earth as thou believ ’ st ;
For light ’ ning scap ’ d from its own <unk> place
Ne ’ er ran , as thou hast hither now return ’ d . ”
Although <unk> of my <unk> ’ d doubt ,
By those brief words , accompanied with smiles ,
Yet in new doubt was I <unk> more ,
And said : “ Already satisfied , I rest
From <unk> deep , but now admire
How I above those lighter bodies rise . ”
Whence , after utt ’ rance of a piteous sigh ,
She tow ’ rds me bent her eyes , with such a look ,
As on her <unk> child a mother casts ;
Then thus began : “ Among themselves all things
Have order ; and from hence the form , which makes
The universe <unk> God . In this
The higher creatures see the <unk> steps
Of that eternal worth , which is the end
Whither the line is drawn . All natures lean ,
In this their order , diversely , some more ,
Some less approaching to their primal source .
Thus they to different <unk> are mov ’ d on
Through the vast sea of being , and each one
With <unk> giv ’ n , that bears it in its course ;
This to the <unk> sphere directs the fire ,
This prompts the hearts of mortal animals ,
This the brute earth together knits , and binds .
Nor only creatures , void of intellect ,
Are aim ’ d at by this bow ; but even those ,
That have intelligence and love , are pierc ’ d .
That Providence , who so well <unk> all ,
With her own light makes ever calm the heaven ,
In which the substance , that hath <unk> speed ,
Is turn ’ d : and thither now , as to our seat
<unk> ’ d , we are carried by the force
Of that strong cord , that never <unk> dart ,
But at fair aim and glad . Yet is it true ,
That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
To the design of art , through <unk>
Of <unk> matter , so this course
Is sometimes quitted by the creature , who
Hath power , directed thus , to bend elsewhere ;
As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall ,
From its original impulse warp ’ d , to earth ,
By vicious fondness . Thou no more admire
Thy <unk> , ( if I rightly deem , ) than <unk>
Of torrent downwards from a mountain ’ s height .
There would in thee for wonder be more cause ,
If , free of hind ’ rance , thou hadst fix ’ d thyself
Below , like fire <unk> on the earth . ”
So said , she turn ’ d toward the heav ’ n her face .
CANTO II
All ye , who in small bark have following sail ’ d ,
Eager to listen , on the <unk> ’ rous track
Of my proud <unk> , that singing cuts its way ,
Backward return with speed , and your own shores
<unk> , nor put out to open sea ,
Where <unk> me , perchance ye may remain
Bewilder ’ d in deep <unk> . The way I pass
Ne ’ er yet was run : Minerva breathes the <unk> ,
Apollo guides me , and another Nine
To my <unk> sight the <unk> beams reveal .
Ye other few , who have outstretch ’ d the neck .
<unk> for food of angels , on which here
They live , yet never know satiety ,
Through the deep <unk> ye fearless may put out
Your vessel , marking , well the <unk> broad
Before you in the wave , that on both sides
<unk> returns . Those , glorious , who pass ’ d o ’ er
To Colchos , wonder ’ d not as ye will do ,
When they saw Jason following the <unk> .
The <unk> perpetual thirst , that draws
Toward the realm of God ’ s own form , bore us
Swift almost as the heaven ye behold .
Beatrice upward gaz ’ d , and I on her ,
And in such space as on the notch a dart
Is plac ’ d , then loosen ’ d flies , I saw myself
Arriv ’ d , where wond ’ rous thing <unk> ’ d my sight .
Whence she , to whom no work of mine was hid ,
Turning to me , with aspect glad as fair ,
Bespake me : “ <unk> direct thy mind
To God , through whom to this first star we come . ”
Me seem ’ d as if a cloud had cover ’ d us ,
<unk> , solid , firm , and polish ’ d bright ,
Like adamant , which the sun ’ s beam had <unk>
Within itself the <unk> pearl
Receiv ’ d us , as the wave a ray of light
Receives , and rests <unk> . If I then
Was of corporeal frame , and it <unk>
Our <unk> thought , how one <unk> thus
Another could endure , which needs must be
If body enter body , how much more
Must the desire <unk> us to behold
That essence , which discovers by what means
God and our nature join ’ d ! There will be seen
That which we hold through faith , not shown by proof ,
But in itself <unk> plain ,
E ’ en as the truth that man at first <unk> .
I answered : “ Lady ! I with thoughts devout ,
Such as I best can frame , give thanks to Him ,
Who hath remov ’ d me from the mortal world .
But tell , I pray thee , whence the gloomy spots
Upon this body , which below on earth
Give rise to talk of Cain in <unk> <unk> ? ”
She somewhat smil ’ d , then spake : “ If mortals err
In their opinion , when the key of sense
<unk> not , surely wonder ’ s weapon keen
<unk> not to pierce thee ; since thou find ’ st , the wings
Of reason to pursue the senses ’ flight
Are short . But what thy own thought is , declare . ”
Then I : “ What various here above appears ,
Is caus ’ d , I deem , by bodies dense or rare . ”
She then resum ’ d : “ Thou certainly wilt see
In falsehood thy belief o ’ erwhelm ’ d , if well
Thou listen to the arguments , which I
Shall bring to face it . The eighth sphere <unk>
<unk> lights , the which in kind and size
May be <unk> ’ d of different <unk> ;
If rare or dense of that were cause alone ,
One single virtue then would be in all ,
Alike distributed , or more , or less .
Different virtues needs must be the fruits
Of formal <unk> , and these , save one ,
Will by thy reasoning be destroy ’ d . Beside ,
If rarity were of that dusk the cause ,
Which thou inquirest , either in some part
That planet must throughout be void , nor fed
With its own matter ; or , as bodies share
Their fat and leanness , in like manner this
Must in its volume change the leaves . The first ,
If it were true , had through the sun ’ s <unk>
Been <unk> , by <unk>
Of light , as through aught rare beside <unk> ’ d .
But this is not . Therefore remains to see
The other cause : and if the other fall ,
Erroneous so must prove what seem ’ d to thee .
If not from side to side this rarity
Pass through , there needs must be a limit , whence
Its contrary no further lets it pass .
And hence the beam , that from without proceeds ,
Must be pour ’ d back , as colour comes , through glass
Reflected , which behind it lead conceals .
Now wilt thou say , that there of murkier hue
Than in the other part the ray is shown ,
By being thence refracted farther back .
From this <unk> will free thee soon
Experience , if thereof thou trial make ,
The fountain whence your arts <unk> their <unk> .
Three mirrors shalt thou take , and two remove
From thee alike , and more remote the third .
Betwixt the former pair , shall meet thine eyes ;
Then turn ’ d toward them , cause behind thy back
A light to stand , that on the three shall shine ,
And thus reflected come to thee from all .
Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
A space so ample , yet in brightness thou
Will own it equaling the rest . But now ,
As under snow the ground , if the warm ray
Smites it , remains <unk> of the hue
And cold , that cover ’ d it before , so thee ,
<unk> in thy mind , I will inform
With light so lively , that the tremulous beam
Shall quiver where it falls . Within the heaven ,
Where peace divine inhabits , circles round
A body , in whose virtue dies the being
Of all that it contains . The following heaven ,
That hath so many lights , this being <unk> ,
Through different <unk> , from it distinct ,
And yet contain ’ d within it . The other orbs
Their separate <unk> <unk>
<unk> , for their own seed and produce apt .
Thus do these organs of the world proceed ,
As thou beholdest now , from step to step ,
Their <unk> from above <unk> ,
And thence <unk> downwards . Mark me well ,
How through this passage to the truth I ford ,
The truth thou lov ’ st , that thou henceforth alone ,
May ’ st know to keep the shallows , safe , untold .
“ The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs ,
As <unk> by the workman ’ s hand , must needs
By blessed <unk> be inspir ’ d . This heaven ,
Made beauteous by so many luminaries ,
From the deep spirit , that moves its circling sphere ,
Its image takes an impress as a seal :
And as the soul , that dwells within your dust ,
Through members different , yet together form ’ d ,
In different pow ’ rs <unk> itself ; e ’ en so
The intellectual efficacy unfolds
Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars ;
On its own <unk> <unk> still .
Different virtue compact different
Makes with the precious body it <unk> ,
With which it knits , as life in you is knit .
From its original nature full of joy ,
The virtue mingled through the body shines ,
As joy through <unk> of the living eye .
From hence proceeds , that which from light to light
Seems different , and not from dense or rare .
This is the formal cause , that generates
<unk> ’ d to its power , the dusk or clear . ”
CANTO III
That sun , which erst with love my bosom warm ’ d
Had of fair truth unveil ’ d the sweet aspect ,
By proof of right , and of the false reproof ;
And I , to own myself <unk> ’ d and free
Of doubt , as much as needed , rais ’ d my head
<unk> for speech . But soon a sight appear ’ d ,
Which , so intent to mark it , held me fix ’ d ,
That of confession I no longer thought .
As through <unk> and smooth glass , or wave
Clear and unmov ’ d , and <unk> not so deep
As that its bed is dark , the shape returns
So faint of our <unk> ’ d lineaments ,
That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
Comes to the eye : such saw I many a face ,
All stretch ’ d to speak , from whence I straight conceiv ’ d
<unk> opposite to that , which rais ’ d
Between the man and fountain , amorous flame .
Sudden , as I perceiv ’ d them , <unk> these
Reflected semblances to see of whom
They were , I turn ’ d mine eyes , and nothing saw ;
Then turn ’ d them back , directed on the light
Of my sweet guide , who smiling shot forth beams
From her celestial eyes . “ Wonder not thou , ”
She cry ’ d , “ at this my smiling , when I see
Thy <unk> judgment ; since not yet on truth
It rests the foot , but , as it still is wont ,
Makes thee fall back in unsound <unk> .
True <unk> are these , which thou behold ’ st ,
Hither through failure of their vow <unk> ’ d .
But speak thou with them ; listen , and believe ,
That the true light , which fills them with desire ,
Permits not from its beams their feet to stray . ”
Straight to the shadow which for converse seem ’ d
Most earnest , I addressed me , and began ,
As one by <unk> perplex ’ d :
“ O spirit , born for joy ! who in the rays
Of life eternal , of that sweetness know ’ st
The flavour , which , not tasted , passes far
All apprehension , me it well would please ,
If thou wouldst tell me of thy name , and this
Your station here . ” Whence she , with kindness prompt ,
And eyes <unk> ’ ning with smiles : “ Our charity ,
To any wish by justice introduc ’ d ,
<unk> not the door , no more than she above ,
Who would have all her court be like herself .
I was a virgin sister in the earth ;
And if thy mind observe me well , this form ,
With such addition grac ’ d of loveliness ,
Will not conceal me long , but thou wilt know
Piccarda , in the <unk> sphere thus plac ’ d ,
Here ’ mid these other blessed also blest .
Our hearts , whose high affections burn alone
With pleasure , from the <unk> Spirit conceiv ’ d ,
<unk> to his order dwell in joy .
And this condition , which appears so low ,
Is for this cause assign ’ d us , that our vows
Were in some part neglected and made void . ”
Whence I to her replied : “ Something divine
<unk> in your countenance , wond ’ rous fair ,
From former knowledge quite <unk> you .
Therefore to <unk> was I so slow .
But what thou sayst hath to my memory
Given now such aid , that to retrace your forms
Is easier . Yet inform me , ye , who here
Are happy , long ye for a higher place
More to behold , and more in love to dwell ? ”
She with those other spirits gently smil ’ d ,
Then answer ’ d with such gladness , that she seem ’ d
With love ’ s first flame to glow : “ Brother ! our will
Is in <unk> settled by the power
Of charity , who makes us will alone
What we possess , and nought beyond desire ;
If we should wish to be exalted more ,
Then must our wishes <unk> with the high will
Of him , who sets us here , which in these orbs
Thou wilt confess not possible , if here
To be in charity must needs befall ,
And if her nature well thou <unk> .
Rather it is <unk> in this state
Of blessedness , to keep ourselves within
The divine will , by which our wills with his
Are one . So that as we from step to step
Are plac ’ d throughout this kingdom , pleases all ,
E ’ en as our King , who in us plants his will ;
And in his will is our <unk> ;
It is the mighty ocean , whither tends
Whatever it <unk> and nature makes . ”
Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav ’ n
Is Paradise , though with like gracious dew
The supreme virtue show ’ r not over all .
But as it chances , if one sort of food
Hath <unk> , and of another still
The appetite remains , that this is ask ’ d ,
And thanks for that return ’ d ; e ’ en so did I
In word and motion , bent from her to learn
What web it was , through which she had not drawn
The shuttle to its point . She thus began :
“ Exalted worth and <unk> of life
The Lady higher up <unk> in heaven ,
By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
The robe and veil they wear , to that intent ,
That e ’ en till death they may keep watch or sleep
With their great <unk> , who accepts each vow ,
Which to his gracious pleasure love <unk> .
from the world , to follow her , when young
<unk> ’ d ; and , in her vesture <unk> me ,
Made promise of the way her sect <unk> .
<unk> men , for ill than good more apt ,
Forth snatch ’ d me from the pleasant cloister ’ s pale .
God knows how after that my life was fram ’ d .
This other <unk> shape , which thou <unk>
At my right side , burning with all the light
Of this our orb , what of myself I tell
May to herself apply . From her , like me
A sister , with like violence were torn
The saintly folds , that shaded her fair brows .
E ’ en when she to the world again was brought
In spite of her own will and better wont ,
Yet not for that the bosom ’ s inward veil
Did she <unk> . This is the luminary
Of mighty Constance , who from that loud blast ,
Which blew the second over <unk> ’ s realm ,
That power produc ’ d , which was the third and last . ”
She ceas ’ d from further talk , and then began
“ <unk> <unk> ” singing , and with that song
Vanish ’ d , as heavy substance through deep wave .
Mine eye , that far as it was <unk> ,
Pursued her , when in <unk> she was lost ,
Turn ’ d to the mark where greater want impell ’ d ,
And bent on Beatrice all its gaze .
But she as light ’ ning beam ’ d upon my looks :
So that the sight sustain ’ d it not at first .
Whence I to question her became less prompt .
CANTO IV
Between two <unk> of food , both equally
<unk> and <unk> , first a man might die
Of hunger , ere he one could freely choose .
E ’ en so would stand a <unk> between the maw
Of two fierce wolves , in dread of both alike :
E ’ en so between two <unk> a dog would stand ,
Wherefore , if I was silent , fault nor praise
I to myself impute , by equal doubts
Held in suspense , since of necessity
It <unk> ’ d . Silent was I , yet desire
Was painted in my looks ; and thus I spake
My wish more earnestly than language could .
As Daniel , when the haughty king he freed
From ire , that spurr ’ d him on to deeds unjust
And violent ; so look ’ d Beatrice then .
“ Well I discern , ” she thus her words address ’ d ,
“ How contrary desires each way constrain thee ,
So that thy anxious thought is in itself
Bound up and <unk> , nor breathes freely forth .
Thou <unk> ; if the good intent remain ;
What reason that another ’ s violence
Should <unk> the measure of my fair desert ?
“ <unk> too thou <unk> for doubt , in that it seems ,
That spirits to the stars , as Plato deem ’ d ,
Return . These are the questions which thy will
<unk> equally ; and therefore I the first
Of that will treat which hath the more of gall .
Of <unk> he who is most <unk> ’ d ,
Moses and <unk> , and either John ,
<unk> which thou wilt , nor even Mary ’ s self ,
Have not in any other heav ’ n their seats ,
Than have those spirits which so late thou saw ’ st ;
Nor more or fewer years exist ; but all
Make the first circle beauteous , diversely
<unk> of sweet life , as more or less
<unk> of eternal bliss <unk> them .
Here were they shown thee , not that fate <unk>
This for their sphere , but for a sign to thee
Of that celestial <unk> from the height .
Thus needs , that ye may apprehend , we speak :
Since from things sensible alone ye learn
That , which <unk> rightly after turns
To intellectual . For no other cause
The <unk> , <unk> graciously
To your perception , hands and feet to God
<unk> , nor so means : and holy church
Doth represent with human countenance
<unk> , and Michael , and him who made
<unk> whole . <unk> what here thou seest ,
The judgment of <unk> , who <unk>
Each soul restor ’ d to its <unk> star ,
Believing it to have been taken thence ,
When nature gave it to inform her <unk> :
Since to appearance his <unk> is
E ’ en what his words declare : or else to shun
<unk> , haply thus he hath disguis ’ d
His true opinion . If his meaning be ,
That to the <unk> of these orbs <unk>
The honour and the blame in human acts ,
Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth .
This <unk> , not understood aright ,
Erewhile <unk> well nigh all the world ;
So that it fell to fabled names of Jove ,
And <unk> , and Mars . That other doubt ,
Which moves thee , is less harmful ; for it brings
No peril of removing thee from me .
“ That , to the eye of man , our justice seems
<unk> , is argument for faith , and not
For <unk> <unk> . To the end
This truth may stand more clearly in your view ,
I will content thee even to thy wish
“ If violence be , when that which suffers , nought
<unk> to that which <unk> , not for this
These spirits stood exculpate . For the will ,
That will not , still <unk> unquench ’ d , and doth
As nature doth in fire , <unk> ’ violence
<unk> it a thousand times ; for , if it yield
Or more or less , so far it follows force .
And thus did these , whom they had power to seek
The hallow ’ d place again . In them , had will
Been perfect , such as once upon the bars
Held <unk> firm , or wrought in <unk>
To his own hand remorseless , to the path ,
Whence they were drawn , their steps had hasten ’ d back ,
When liberty return ’ d : but in too few
<unk> so steadfast dwells . And by these words
If duly weigh ’ d , that argument is void ,
Which oft might have perplex ’ d thee still . But now
Another question <unk> thee , which to solve
Might try thy patience without better aid .
I have , no doubt , <unk> ’ d into thy mind ,
That blessed spirit may not lie ; since near
The source of primal truth it dwells for aye :
And thou might ’ st after of Piccarda learn
That Constance held affection to the veil ;
So that she seems to contradict me here .
Not seldom , brother , it hath chanc ’ d for men
To do what they had gladly left <unk> ,
Yet to shun peril they have done <unk> :
E ’ en as Alcmaeon , at his father ’ s suit
<unk> his own mother , so made pitiless
Not to lose pity . On this point bethink thee ,
That force and will are blended in such wise
As not to make the ’ offence <unk> .
<unk> will agrees not to the wrong ,
That <unk> as there is fear of woe
From <unk> , it agrees . Of will
Thus absolute Piccarda spake , and I
Of th ’ other ; so that both have truly said . ”
Such was the flow of that pure rill , that well ’ d
From forth the fountain of all truth ; and such
The rest , that to my wond ’ ring thoughts I found .
“ O thou of primal love the prime delight !
<unk> ! ” I straight reply ’ d , “ whose lively words
Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul !
Affection fails me to requite thy grace
With equal sum of <unk> : be his
To recompense , who sees and can reward thee .
Well I discern , that by that truth alone
<unk> ’ d , beyond which no truth may roam ,
Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know :
<unk> she <unk> , e ’ en as in his lair
The wild beast , soon as she hath reach ’ d that bound ,
And she hath power to reach it ; else desire
Were given to no end . And thence doth doubt
Spring , like a shoot , around the stock of truth ;
And it is nature which from height to height
On to the summit prompts us . This invites ,
This doth assure me , lady , rev ’ <unk>
To ask thee of other truth , that yet
Is dark to me . I fain would know , if man
By other works well done may so supply
The failure of his vows , that in your scale
They lack not weight . ” I spake ; and on me straight
Beatrice look ’ d with eyes that shot forth sparks
Of love celestial in such copious stream ,
That , virtue sinking in me overpower ’ d ,
I turn ’ d , and downward bent confus ’ d my sight .
CANTO V
“ If beyond earthly wont , the flame of love
<unk> me , so that I o ’ ercome thy power
Of vision , marvel not : but learn the cause
In that perfection of the sight , which soon
As <unk> , <unk> on to reach
The good it <unk> . I well discern ,
How in thine intellect already shines
The light eternal , which to view alone
Ne ’ er fails to <unk> love ; and if aught else
Your love <unk> , ’ t is but that it shows
Some <unk> ’ d vestige of that primal beam .
“ This would ’ st thou know , if failure of the vow
By other service may be so supplied ,
As from <unk> to assure the soul . ”
Thus she her words , not heedless of my wish ,
Began ; and thus , as one who breaks not off
Discourse , <unk> in her saintly strain .
“ Supreme of gifts , which God creating gave
Of his free bounty , sign most <unk>
Of goodness , and in his account most priz ’ d ,
Was liberty of will , the boon wherewith
All intellectual creatures , and them sole
He hath <unk> ’ d . Hence now thou mayst infer
Of what high worth the vow , which so is fram ’ d
That when man <unk> , God well-pleas ’ d accepts ;
For in the compact between God and him ,
This treasure , such as I describe it to thee ,
He makes the victim , and of his own act .
What compensation therefore may he find ?
If that , whereof thou hast <unk> made ,
By using well thou think ’ st to <unk> ,
Thou would ’ st of theft do <unk> deed .
Thus I resolve thee of the greater point .
“ But <unk> as holy church , <unk>
<unk> , seems to contradict the truth
I have discover ’ d to thee , yet behooves
Thou rest a little longer at the <unk> ,
Ere the crude aliment , which thou hast taken ,
<unk> fitly to <unk> turn .
Open thy mind to what I now unfold ,
And give it inward keeping . <unk> comes
Of learning well retain ’ d , <unk> else .
“ This sacrifice in essence of two things
<unk> ; one is that , whereof ’ t is made ,
The covenant the other . For the last ,
It ne ’ er is <unk> ’ d if not kept : and hence
I spake erewhile so strictly of its force .
For this it was enjoin ’ d the <unk> ,
Though leave were giv ’ n them , as thou know ’ st , to change
The <unk> , still to offer . Th ’ other part ,
The matter and the substance of the vow ,
May well be such , to that without offence
It may for other substance be exchang ’ d .
But at his own <unk> none may shift
The burden on his shoulders , <unk> ’ d
By either key , the yellow and the white .
Nor deem of any change , as less than vain ,
If the last bond be not within the new
