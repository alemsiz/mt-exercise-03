Which well <unk> <unk> . ” Scarce his words
Were ended , when I saw the miry tribes
Set on him with such violence , that yet
For that render I thanks to God and praise
“ To <unk> <unk> : ” cried they all :
And on himself the <unk> Florentine
Turn ’ d his <unk> fangs . Him here we left ,
Nor speak I of him more . But on mine ear
Sudden a sound of <unk> smote ,
Whereat mine eye <unk> ’ d I sent abroad .
And thus the good instructor : “ Now , my son !
<unk> near the city , that of Dis is nam ’ d ,
With its grave <unk> , a mighty throng . ”
I thus : “ The <unk> already , Sir !
There <unk> in the valley I descry ,
<unk> vermilion , as if they from fire
Had issu ’ d . ” He replied : “ Eternal fire ,
That inward burns , shows them with ruddy flame
<unk> ’ d ; as in this nether hell thou seest . ”
We came within the fosses deep , that moat
This region <unk> . The walls appear ’ d
As they were fram ’ d of iron . We had made
<unk> circuit , ere a place we reach ’ d , where loud
The <unk> cried vehement : “ Go forth !
The entrance is here ! ” Upon the gates I spied
More than a thousand , who of old from heaven
Were hurl ’ d . With <unk> <unk> , “ Who is this , ”
They cried , “ that without death first felt , goes through
The regions of the dead ? ” My sapient guide
Made sign that he for secret parley wish ’ d ;
Whereat their angry scorn <unk> , thus
They spake : “ Come thou alone ; and let him go
Who hath so <unk> enter ’ d this realm .
Alone return he by his witless way ;
If well he know it , let him prove . For thee ,
Here shalt thou tarry , who through clime so dark
Hast been his escort . ” Now bethink thee , reader !
What cheer was mine at sound of those curs ’ d words .
I did believe I never should return .
“ O my lov ’ d guide ! who more than seven times
<unk> hast render ’ d me , and drawn
From peril deep , whereto I stood expos ’ d ,
Desert me not , ” I cried , “ in this extreme .
And if our onward going be denied ,
Together trace we back our steps with speed . ”
My liege , who thither had conducted me ,
Replied : “ Fear not : for of our passage none
Hath power to <unk> us , by such high
<unk> permitted . But do thou
Expect me here ; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
<unk> , and feed with kindly hope , assur ’ d
I will not leave thee in this lower world . ”
This said , departs the sire <unk> ,
And quits me . <unk> I remain
At war ’ twixt will and will not in my thoughts .
I could not hear what terms he offer ’ d them ,
But they <unk> ’ d not long , for all at once
To trial fled within . <unk> ’ d were the gates
By those our <unk> on the breast
Of my liege lord : <unk> he return ’ d
To me with tardy steps . Upon the ground
His eyes were bent , and from his brow eras ’ d
All confidence , while thus with sighs he spake :
“ Who hath denied me these <unk> of woe ? ”
Then thus to me : “ That I am anger ’ d , think
No ground of terror : in this trial I
Shall vanquish , use what arts they may within
For hindrance . This their insolence , not new ,
Erewhile at gate less secret they display ’ d ,
Which still is without bolt ; upon its arch
Thou saw ’ st the deadly scroll : and even now
On this side of its entrance , down the steep ,
Passing the circles , <unk> , comes
One whose strong might can open us this land . ”
CANTO IX
The hue , which <unk> dread on my pale cheeks
<unk> , when I saw my guide turn back ,
<unk> ’ d that from his which newly they had worn ,
And inwardly restrain ’ d it . He , as one
Who listens , stood attentive : for his eye
Not far could lead him through the sable air ,
And the <unk> ’ ring cloud . “ It yet behooves
We win this fight ” — thus he began — “ if not —
Such aid to us is offer ’ d . — Oh , how long
Me seems it , ere the promis ’ d help arrive ! ”
I noted , how the <unk> of his words
<unk> ’ d their beginning ; for the last he spake
<unk> not with the first . But not the less
My fear was at his saying ; <unk> I drew
To import worse perchance , than that he held ,
His mutilated speech . “ Doth ever any
Into this rueful concave ’ s extreme depth
Descend , out of the first degree , whose pain
Is <unk> <unk> of sweet hope ? ”
Thus I inquiring . “ Rarely , ” he replied ,
“ It chances , that among us any makes
This journey , which I <unk> . Erewhile ’ tis true
Once came I here beneath , conjur ’ d by fell
<unk> , <unk> , who compell ’ d the shades
<unk> to their bodies . No long space my flesh
Was naked of me , when within these walls
She made me enter , to draw forth a spirit
From out of Judas ’ circle . <unk> place
Is that of all , <unk> , and remov ’ d
<unk> from heav ’ n ’ s <unk> orb . The road
Full well I know : thou therefore rest secure .
That lake , the noisome stench <unk> , round
The city ’ of grief <unk> , which now
We may not enter without rage . ” Yet more
He added : but I hold it not in mind ,
For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
Had drawn me wholly , to its burning top .
Where in an instant I beheld <unk>
At once three <unk> <unk> stain ’ d with blood :
In limb and motion <unk> they seem ’ d ;
Around them <unk> <unk> twisting roll ’ d
Their <unk> ; <unk> and <unk> crept
Instead of hair , and their fierce temples bound .
He knowing well the miserable <unk>
Who tend the queen of endless woe , thus spake :
“ Mark thou each dire <unk> . To the left
This is <unk> ; on the right hand she ,
Who wails , <unk> ; and <unk>
I ’ th ’ midst . ” This said , in silence he remain ’ d
Their breast they each one <unk> tore ; themselves
Smote with their palms , and such shrill clamour rais ’ d ,
That to the bard I <unk> , <unk> .
“ <unk> <unk> : so to adamant
Him shall we change ; ” all looking down exclaim ’ d .
“ E ’ en when by Theseus ’ might assail ’ d , we took
No ill revenge . ” “ Turn thyself round , and keep
Thy count ’ nance hid ; for if the <unk> dire
Be shown , and thou shouldst view it , thy return
<unk> would be for ever lost . ” This said ,
Himself my gentle master turn ’ d me round ,
Nor trusted he my hands , but with his own
He also hid me . Ye of intellect
Sound and <unk> , mark well the lore conceal ’ d
Under close texture of the mystic strain !
And now there came o ’ er the <unk> waves
<unk> , terrible , a sound that made
Either shore tremble , as if of a wind
<unk> , from conflicting vapours sprung ,
That ’ gainst some forest <unk> all its might ,
<unk> off the branches , beats them down and <unk>
<unk> ; then onward passing proudly sweeps
Its whirlwind rage , while beasts and shepherds fly .
Mine eyes he loos ’ d , and spake : “ And now direct
Thy <unk> nerve along that ancient foam ,
There , <unk> where the smoke ascends . ” As frogs
Before their foe the serpent , through the wave
<unk> swiftly all , till at the ground each one
Lies on a heap ; more than a thousand spirits
Destroy ’ d , so saw I fleeing before one
Who pass ’ d with <unk> feet the Stygian sound .
He , from his face removing the gross air ,
Oft his left hand forth stretch ’ d , and seem ’ d alone
By that <unk> wearied . I perceiv ’ d
That he was sent from heav ’ n , and to my guide
Turn ’ d me , who signal made that I should stand
<unk> , and bend to him . Ah me ! how full
Of noble anger seem ’ d he ! To the gate
He came , and with his wand touch ’ d it , whereat
Open without impediment it flew .
“ <unk> of heav ’ n ! O abject race and scorn ’ d ! ”
Began he on the horrid <unk> standing ,
“ Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
<unk> in you ? wherefore <unk> you ’ gainst that will
Ne ’ er <unk> of its end , and which so oft
Hath laid on you <unk> of your pangs ?
What profits at the <unk> to but the horn ?
Your Cerberus , if ye remember , hence
Bears still , <unk> ’ d of their hair , his throat and maw . ”
This said , he turn ’ d back o ’ er the filthy way ,
And syllable to us spake none , but wore
The semblance of a man by other care
<unk> , and keenly press ’ d , than thought of him
Who in his presence stands . Then we our steps
Toward that territory mov ’ d , secure
After the hallow ’ d words . We <unk> ’ d
There enter ’ d ; and my mind eager to learn
What state a fortress like to that might hold ,
I soon as enter ’ d throw mine eye around ,
And see on every part <unk> space
<unk> with bitter pain and torment ill .
As where <unk> <unk> on the plains of <unk> ,
Or as at <unk> , near <unk> ’ s gulf ,
That closes Italy and <unk> her bounds ,
The place is all thick spread with sepulchres ;
So was it here , save what in horror here
<unk> ’ d : for ’ midst the <unk> were <unk> flames ,
Wherewith <unk> all throughout they burn ’ d ,
That iron for no craft there <unk> needs .
Their lids all hung suspended , and beneath
From them forth issu ’ d lamentable moans ,
Such as the sad and tortur ’ d well might raise .
I thus : “ Master ! say who are these , <unk> ’ d
Within these <unk> , of whom distinct we hear
The dolorous sighs ? ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ The <unk> are here , accompanied
By every sect their followers ; and much more ,
Than thou believest , tombs are freighted : like
With like is buried ; and the <unk>
Are different in degrees of heat . ” This said ,
He to the right hand turning , on we pass ’ d
Betwixt the afflicted and the <unk> high .
CANTO X
Now by a secret pathway we proceed ,
Between the walls , that hem the region round ,
And the tormented souls : my master first ,
I close behind his steps . “ Virtue supreme ! ”
I thus began ; “ who through these ample orbs
In circuit lead ’ st me , even as thou will ’ st ,
Speak thou , and satisfy my wish . May those ,
Who lie within these sepulchres , be seen ?
Already all the lids are rais ’ d , and none
O ’ er them keeps watch . ” He thus in answer spake
“ They shall be closed all , <unk> they here
From <unk> return ’ d shall come , and bring
Their bodies , which above they now have left .
The <unk> on this part obtain
With <unk> all his followers ,
Who with the body make the spirit die .
Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
Both to the question ask ’ d , and to the wish ,
Which thou conceal ’ st in silence . ” I replied :
“ I keep not , guide belov ’ d ! from thee my heart
<unk> , but to shun vain length of words ,
A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself . ”
“ O Tuscan ! thou who through the city of fire
Alive art passing , so discreet of speech !
Here please thee stay awhile . Thy utterance
<unk> the place of thy <unk>
To be that noble land , with which perchance
I too <unk> <unk> . ” Sudden that sound
Forth issu ’ d from a vault , whereat in fear
I somewhat closer to my leader ’ s side
Approaching , he thus spake : “ What dost thou ? Turn .
Lo , Farinata , there ! who hath himself
Uplifted : from his girdle upwards all
<unk> ’ d behold him . ” On his face was mine
Already fix ’ d ; his breast and forehead there
<unk> , seem ’ d as in high scorn he held
E ’ en hell . Between the sepulchres to him
My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt ,
This warning added : “ See thy words be clear ! ”
He , soon as there I stood at the tomb ’ s foot ,
<unk> ’ d me a space , then in disdainful mood
Address ’ d me : “ Say , what <unk> were thine ? ”
I , willing to obey him , straight reveal ’ d
The whole , nor kept back aught : whence he , his brow
Somewhat uplifting , cried : “ <unk> were they
Adverse to me , my party , and the blood
From whence I sprang : twice therefore I abroad
<unk> ’ d them . ” “ Though driv ’ n out , yet they each time
From all parts , ” answer ’ d I , “ return ’ d ; an art
Which yours have shown , they are not skill ’ d to learn . ”
Then , <unk> forth from the unclosed jaw ,
Rose from his side a shade , high as the chin ,
Leaning , methought , upon its knees uprais ’ d .
It look ’ d around , as eager to explore
If there were other with me ; but perceiving
That fond imagination quench ’ d , with tears
Thus spake : “ If thou through this blind prison go ’ st .
Led by thy lofty genius and profound ,
Where is my son ? and wherefore not with thee ? ”
I straight replied : “ Not of myself I come ,
By him , who there <unk> me , through this clime
Conducted , whom perchance Guido thy son
Had in <unk> . ” Already had his words
And <unk> of punishment read me his name ,
Whence I so fully answer ’ d . He at once
Exclaim ’ d , up <unk> , “ How ! said ’ st thou he <unk> ?
No longer lives he ? Strikes not on his eye
The blessed daylight ? ” Then of some delay
I made ere my reply aware , down fell
Supine , not after forth appear ’ d he more .
Meanwhile the other , great of soul , near whom
I yet was station ’ d , chang ’ d not count ’ nance stern ,
Nor mov ’ d the neck , nor bent his <unk> side .
“ And if , ” <unk> the first discourse ,
“ They in this art , ” he cried , “ small skill have shown ,
That doth torment me more e ’ en than this bed .
But not yet fifty times shall be <unk> ’ d
Her aspect , who reigns here Queen of this realm ,
Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art .
So to the pleasant world mayst thou return ,
As thou shalt tell me , why in all their laws ,
Against my kin this people is so fell ? ”
“ The slaughter and great havoc , ” I replied ,
“ That colour ’ d <unk> ’ s flood with crimson stain —
To these impute , that in our hallow ’ d dome
Such orisons ascend . ” <unk> he shook
The head , then thus resum ’ d : “ In that <unk>
I stood not singly , nor without just cause
<unk> should with the rest have stirr ’ d ;
But singly there I stood , when by consent
Of all , Florence had to the ground been raz ’ d ,
The one who <unk> <unk> the deed . ”
“ So may thy lineage find at last repose , ”
I thus <unk> ’ d him , “ as thou solve this knot ,
Which now involves my mind . If right I hear ,
Ye seem to view <unk> , that which time
Leads with him , of the present <unk> ’ d . ”
“ We view , as one who hath an evil sight , ”
He answer ’ d , “ plainly , <unk> far remote :
So much of his large <unk> yet <unk>
The Almighty <unk> ; but when they approach
Or <unk> exist , our intellect
Then wholly fails , nor of your human state
Except what others bring us know we aught .
Hence therefore mayst thou understand , that all
Our knowledge in that instant shall <unk> ,
When on <unk> the <unk> close . ”
Then <unk> of my fault , and by remorse
<unk> , I added thus : “ Now shalt thou say
To him there fallen , that his offspring still
Is to the living join ’ d ; and bid him know ,
That if from answer silent I <unk> ’ d ,
’ <unk> that my thought was <unk> intent
Upon that error , which thy help hath solv ’ d . ”
But now my master <unk> me back
I heard , and with more eager haste besought
The spirit to inform me , who with him
<unk> his lot . He answer thus return ’ d :
“ More than a thousand with me here are laid
Within is Frederick , second of that name ,
And the Lord <unk> , and of the rest
I speak not . ” He , this said , from sight <unk> .
But I my steps towards the ancient bard
<unk> , <unk> on the words
<unk> me such ill . Onward he mov ’ d ,
And thus in going question ’ d : “ Whence the amaze
That holds thy senses wrapt ? ” I satisfied
The inquiry , and the sage enjoin ’ d me straight :
“ Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
To thee <unk> harm ; and note thou this , ”
With his rais ’ d finger bidding me take heed ,
“ When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam ,
Whose bright eye all surveys , she of thy life
The future tenour will to thee unfold . ”
Forthwith he to the left hand turn ’ d his feet :
We left the wall , and tow ’ rds the middle space
Went by a path , that to a valley strikes ;
Which e ’ en thus high exhal ’ d its noisome steam .
CANTO XI
Upon the utmost verge of a high bank ,
By craggy rocks <unk> ’ d round , we came ,
Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow ’ d :
And here to shun the horrible excess
Of <unk> <unk> , upward cast
From the profound abyss , behind the <unk>
Of a great <unk> we stood retir ’ d ,
Whereon this scroll I mark ’ d : “ I have in charge
<unk> <unk> , whom <unk> drew
From the right path . — Ere our descent behooves
We make delay , that somewhat first the sense ,
To the dire breath accustom ’ d , afterward
<unk> it not . ” My master thus ; to whom
<unk> I spake : “ Some compensation find
That the time past not wholly lost . ” He then :
“ Lo ! how my thoughts e ’ en to thy wishes tend !
My son ! within these rocks , ” he thus began ,
“ Are three close circles in <unk> plac ’ d ,
As these which now thou <unk> ’ st . Each one is full
Of spirits accurs ’ d ; but that the sight alone
<unk> may suffice thee , listen how
And for what cause in <unk> they abide .
“ Of all <unk> act <unk> ’ d in heaven ,
The end is injury ; and all such end
Either by force or fraud works other ’ s woe
But fraud , because of man <unk> evil ,
To God is more displeasing ; and beneath
The <unk> are therefore doom ’ d to ’ endure
Severer pang . The violent <unk>
All the first circle ; and because to force
Three persons are <unk> , in three rounds
Each within other sep ’ rate is it fram ’ d .
To God , his neighbour , and himself , by man
Force may be offer ’ d ; to himself I say
And his <unk> , as thou soon shalt hear
At full . <unk> , violent death , and <unk> wounds
Upon his neighbour he inflicts ; and wastes
By <unk> , <unk> , and the flames ,
His substance . <unk> , and each one that smites
In malice , plund ’ rers , and all robbers , hence
The torment <unk> of the first round
In different herds . Man can do violence
To himself and his own blessings : and for this
He in the second round must aye deplore
With <unk> penitence his crime ,
Whoe ’ er deprives himself of life and light ,
In <unk> lavishment his <unk> wastes ,
And <unk> there where he should dwell in joy .
To God may force be offer ’ d , in the heart
<unk> and <unk> his high power ,
And nature with her kindly law <unk> .
And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
Sodom and <unk> , and all such as speak
<unk> of the <unk> in their hearts .
“ <unk> , that in every conscience leaves a sting ,
May be by man employ ’ d on one , whose trust
He wins , or on another who <unk>
Strict confidence . Seems as the latter way
Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes .
Whence in the second circle have their nest
<unk> , <unk> , flatteries ,
<unk> , falsehood , simony , all who <unk>
To lust , or set their <unk> at <unk> ,
With such vile <unk> as these . The other way
<unk> both Nature ’ s general love , and that
Which thereto added <unk> gives birth
To <unk> faith . Whence in the lesser circle ,
<unk> of the universe , dread seat of Dis ,
The traitor is <unk> consum ’ d . ”
I thus : “ Instructor , clearly thy discourse
<unk> , <unk> the hideous chasm
And its inhabitants with skill exact .
But tell me this : they of the dull , fat pool ,
Whom the rain beats , or whom the tempest drives ,
Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet ,
Wherefore within the city <unk> ’ d
Are not these punish ’ d , if God ’ s wrath be on them ?
And if it be not , wherefore in such guise
Are they condemned ? ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ Wherefore in <unk> <unk> thus thy mind ,
Not so accustom ’ d ? or what other thoughts
Possess it ? Dwell not in thy memory
The words , wherein thy <unk> page <unk>
Three <unk> adverse to Heav ’ n ’ s will ,
<unk> ’ <unk> , malice , and mad <unk> ,
And how <unk> the least offends
God , and least guilt incurs ? If well thou note
This judgment , and remember who they are ,
Without these walls to vain repentance doom ’ d ,
Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac ’ d
From these fell spirits , and less <unk> pours
Justice divine on them its vengeance down . ”
“ O <unk> ! who <unk> all imperfect sight ,
Thou so content ’ st me , when thou solv ’ st my doubt ,
That ignorance not less than knowledge charms .
Yet somewhat turn thee back , ” I in these words
<unk> ’ d , “ where thou saidst , that <unk>
<unk> celestial <unk> ; and this knot
<unk> ’ d <unk> . ” He thus made reply :
“ <unk> , to an attentive ear ,
<unk> points out , not in one part alone ,
How <unk> nature takes her course
From the celestial mind and from its art :
And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds ,
Not many leaves scann ’ d o ’ er , <unk> well
Thou shalt discover , that your art on her
<unk> follows , as the <unk> treads
In his instructor ’ s step , so that your art
<unk> the name of second in descent
From God . These two , if thou recall to mind
<unk> ’ s holy book , from the beginning
Were the right source of life and <unk>
To human kind . But in another path
The <unk> walks ; and Nature in herself
And in her <unk> thus he sets at nought ,
<unk> elsewhere his hope . But follow now
My steps on forward journey bent ; for now
The Pisces play with <unk> glance
Along the horizon , and the <unk> lies all
O ’ er the <unk> ; and onward there a space
Is our steep passage down the rocky height . ”
CANTO XII
The place where to descend the precipice
We came , was rough as Alp , and on its verge
Such object lay , as every eye would shun .
As is that ruin , which Adice ’ s stream
On this side Trento struck , should ’ ring the wave ,
Or loos ’ d by earthquake or for lack of prop ;
For from the mountain ’ s summit , whence it mov ’ d
To the low level , so the headlong rock
Is shiver ’ d , that some passage it might give
To him who from above would pass ; e ’ en such
Into the chasm was that descent : and there
At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch ’ d
The infamy of Crete , <unk> brood
Of the feign ’ d <unk> : and at sight of us
It gnaw ’ d itself , as one with rage <unk> .
To him my guide exclaim ’ d : “ Perchance thou deem ’ st
The King of Athens here , who , in the world
Above , thy death <unk> ’ d . <unk> ! <unk> !
He comes not <unk> ’ d by thy sister ’ s art ,
But to behold your torments is he come . ”
Like to a bull , that with impetuous spring
<unk> , at the moment when the fatal blow
Hath struck him , but <unk> to proceed
<unk> on either side ; so saw I plunge
The <unk> ; whereat the sage exclaim ’ d :
“ Run to the passage ! while he storms , ’ t is well
That thou descend . ” Thus down our road we took
Through those <unk> crags , that oft
Mov ’ d underneath my feet , to weight like theirs
<unk> ’ d . I pond ’ ring went , and thus he spake :
“ Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin ’ d steep ,
<unk> by the brute violence , which I
Have vanquish ’ d now . Know then , that when I erst
Hither descended to the nether hell ,
This rock was not yet fallen . But past doubt
( If well I mark ) not long ere He arrived ,
Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
Of the highest circle , then through all its bounds
Such trembling seiz ’ d the deep concave and foul ,
I thought the universe was thrill ’ d with love ,
<unk> , there are who deem , the world hath oft
Been into <unk> turn ’ d : and in that point ,
Here , and elsewhere , that old rock <unk> down .
But fix thine eyes beneath : the river of blood
Approaches , in the which all those are steep ’ d ,
Who have by violence injur ’ d . ” O blind lust !
O <unk> wrath ! who so dost <unk> us on
In the brief life , and in the eternal then
Thus <unk> o ’ erwhelm us . I beheld
An ample foss , that in a bow was bent ,
As circling all the plain ; for so my guide
Had told . Between it and the rampart ’ s base
On trail ran <unk> , with keen <unk> arm ’ d ,
As to the chase they on the earth were wont .
At seeing us descend they each one stood ;
And issuing from the troop , three sped with <unk>
And <unk> weapons chosen first ; of whom
One cried from far : “ Say to what pain ye come
<unk> ’ d , who down this steep have <unk> ? Speak
From whence ye stand , or else the bow I draw . ”
To whom my guide : “ Our answer shall be made
To Chiron , there , when nearer him we come .
Ill was thy mind , thus ever quick and <unk> . ”
Then me he touch ’ d , and spake : “ Nessus is this ,
Who for the fair <unk> died ,
And wrought himself revenge for his own fate .
He in the midst , that on his breast looks down ,
Is the great Chiron who Achilles <unk> ’ d ;
That other <unk> , prone to wrath . ” Around
The foss these go by thousands , <unk> <unk>
At whatsoever spirit <unk> <unk>
From out the blood , more than his guilt allows .
We to those beasts , that rapid <unk> along ,
Drew near , when Chiron took an arrow forth ,
And with the notch push ’ d back his shaggy beard
To the cheek-bone , then his great mouth to view
<unk> , to his fellows thus exclaim ’ d :
“ Are ye aware , that he who comes behind
Moves what he touches ? The feet of the dead
Are not so wont . ” My <unk> guide , who now
Stood near his breast , where the two natures join ,
Thus made reply : “ He is indeed alive ,
And solitary so must needs by me
Be shown the gloomy vale , thereto induc ’ d
By strict necessity , not by delight .
She left her joyful <unk> in the sky ,
Who this new office to my care <unk> ’ d .
He is no robber , no dark spirit I.
But by that virtue , which <unk> my step
To treat so wild a path , grant us , I pray ,
One of thy band , whom we may trust secure ,
Who to the ford may lead us , and convey
<unk> , him mounted on his back ; for he
Is not a spirit that may walk the air . ”
Then on his right breast turning , Chiron thus
To Nessus spake : “ Return , and be their guide .
And if ye chance to cross another troop ,
<unk> them keep aloof . ” Onward we mov ’ d ,
The faithful escort by our side , along
The border of the <unk> flood ,
Whence from those steep ’ d within loud shrieks arose .
Some there I mark ’ d , as high as to their brow
<unk> ’ d , of whom the mighty Centaur thus :
“ These are the souls of tyrants , who were given
To blood and rapine . Here they wail aloud
Their merciless wrongs . Here <unk> dwells ,
And <unk> fell , who many a year
Of woe wrought for fair <unk> . That brow
Whereon the hair so <unk> <unk> ’ ring hangs ,
Is <unk> ; that with <unk> locks
<unk> ’ of Este , in the world destroy ’ d
By his foul <unk> . ” To the bard rever ’ d
I <unk> me round , and thus he spake ; “ Let him
Be to thee now first leader , me but next
To him in rank . ” Then farther on a space
The Centaur paus ’ d , near some , who at the throat
Were <unk> from the wave ; and <unk> us
A spirit by itself apart retir ’ d ,
Exclaim ’ d : “ He in God ’ s bosom smote the heart ,
Which yet is honour ’ d on the bank of <unk> . ”
A race I next espied , who held the head ,
And even all the <unk> above the stream .
’ Midst these I many a face remember ’ d well .
Thus <unk> more and more the blood became ,
So that at last it but imbru ’ d the feet ;
And there our passage lay athwart the foss .
“ As ever on this side the boiling wave
Thou seest <unk> , ” the Centaur said ,
“ So on the other , be thou well assur ’ d ,
It lower still and lower <unk> its bed ,
Till in that part it <unk> join ,
Where ’ t is the lot of <unk> to mourn .
There Heav ’ n ’ s stern justice lays <unk> hand
On Attila , who was the scourge of earth ,
On <unk> , and on <unk> , and <unk>
Tears ever by the seething flood <unk> ’ d
From the Rinieri , of Corneto this ,
<unk> the other nam ’ d , who fill ’ d the ways
With violence and war . ” This said , he turn ’ d ,
And <unk> us , alone repass ’ d the ford .
CANTO XIII
Ere Nessus yet had reach ’ d the other bank ,
We enter ’ d on a forest , where no track
Of steps had worn a way . Not verdant there
The foliage , but of dusky hue ; not light
The boughs and <unk> , but with <unk> <unk> ’ d
And <unk> thick : fruits there were none , but thorns
Instead , with venom fill ’ d . Less sharp than these ,
Less <unk> the <unk> , wherein abide
Those animals , that hate the <unk> ’ d fields ,
Betwixt Corneto and <unk> ’ s stream .
Here the brute Harpies make their nest , the same
Who from the <unk> the <unk> band
Drove with dire <unk> of their future woe .
<unk> are their pennons , of the human form
Their neck and count ’ nance , arm ’ d with talons keen
The feet , and the huge belly <unk> with wings
These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood .
The kind instructor in these words began :
“ Ere farther thou proceed , know thou art now
I ’ th ’ second round , and shalt be , till thou come
Upon the horrid sand : look therefore well
Around thee , and such things thou shalt behold ,
As would my speech <unk> . ” On all sides
I heard sad <unk> breathe , and none could see
From whom they might have issu ’ d . In amaze
Fast bound I stood . He , as it seem ’ d , believ ’ d ,
That I had thought so many voices came
From some amid those thickets close conceal ’ d ,
And thus his speech resum ’ d : “ If thou <unk> off
A single <unk> from one of those ill plants ,
The thought thou hast conceiv ’ d shall vanish quite . ”
Thereat a little stretching forth my hand ,
From a great <unk> gather ’ d I a branch ,
And straight the trunk exclaim ’ d : “ Why pluck ’ st thou me ? ”
Then as the dark blood <unk> down its side ,
These words it added : “ Wherefore tear ’ st me thus ?
Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast ?
Men once were we , that now are <unk> here .
Thy hand might well have <unk> ’ d us , had we been
The souls of serpents . ” As a brand yet green ,
That burning at one end from the other <unk>
A <unk> sound , and <unk> with the wind
That forces out its way , so burst at once ,
Forth from the broken splinter words and blood .
I , <unk> fall the bough , remain ’ d as one
<unk> ’ d by terror , and the sage replied :
“ If he , O injur ’ d spirit ! could have believ ’ d
What he hath seen but in my verse <unk> ’ d ,
He never against thee had stretch ’ d his hand .
But I , because the thing surpass ’ d belief ,
<unk> him to this deed , which even now
Myself I rue . But tell me , who thou wast ;
That , for this wrong to do thee some amends ,
In the upper world ( for thither to return
Is granted him ) thy fame he may revive . ”
“ That pleasant word of thine , ” the trunk replied
“ Hath so <unk> me , that I from speech
<unk> refrain , wherein if I indulge
A little longer , in the <unk> detain ’ d ,
Count it not grievous . I it was , who held
Both keys to Frederick ’ s heart , and turn ’ d the <unk> ,
Opening and <unk> , with a skill so sweet ,
That besides me , into his inmost breast
Scarce any other could admittance find .
The faith I bore to my high charge was such ,
It cost me the life-blood that warm ’ d my veins .
The harlot , who ne ’ er turn ’ d her <unk> eyes
From Caesar ’ s <unk> , common vice and <unk>
Of courts , ’ gainst me inflam ’ d the minds of all ;
And to Augustus they so spread the flame ,
That my glad honours chang ’ d to bitter woes .
My soul , disdainful and <unk> , sought
<unk> in death from scorn , and I became ,
Just as I was , unjust toward myself .
By the new roots , which fix this stem , I swear ,
That never faith I broke to my liege lord ,
Who merited such honour ; and of you ,
If any to the world indeed return ,
Clear he from wrong my memory , that lies
Yet prostrate under envy ’ s cruel blow . ”
First somewhat pausing , till the mournful words
Were ended , then to me the bard began :
“ <unk> not the time ; but speak and of him ask ,
If more thou wish to learn . ” Whence I replied :
“ <unk> thou him again of whatsoe ’ er
Will , as thou think ’ st , content me ; for no power
Have I to ask , such pity ’ is at my heart . ”
He thus resum ’ d ; “ So may he do for thee
Freely what thou <unk> , as thou yet
Be pleas ’ d , <unk> ’ d Spirit ! to declare ,
How in these <unk> joints the soul is tied ;
And whether any ever from such frame
Be loosen ’ d , if thou canst , that also tell . ”
Thereat the trunk breath ’ d hard , and the wind soon
<unk> ’ d into sounds <unk> like these ;
<unk> ye shall be answer ’ d . “ When departs
The fierce soul from the body , by itself
Thence torn asunder , to the seventh gulf
By Minos doom ’ d , into the wood it falls ,
No place assign ’ d , but <unk> chance
Hurls it , there <unk> , as a grain of <unk> ,
It rises to a <unk> , <unk> thence
A savage plant . The Harpies , on its leaves
Then feeding , cause both pain and for the pain
A vent to grief . We , as the rest , shall come
For our own spoils , yet not so that with them
We may again be clad ; for what a man
Takes from himself it is not just he have .
Here we perforce shall <unk> them ; and throughout
The dismal <unk> our bodies shall be hung ,
Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade . ”
Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
We stood , <unk> farther speech , when us
A noise surpris ’ d , as when a man perceives
The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
Of station ’ d watch , who of the beasts and boughs
Loud rustling round him hears . And lo ! there came
Two naked , torn with <unk> , in headlong flight ,
That they before them broke each fan o ’ th ’ wood .
“ Haste now , ” the foremost cried , “ now haste thee death ! ”
The other , as seem ’ d , <unk> of delay
Exclaiming , “ <unk> ! not so bent for speed
Thy sinews , in the <unk> of <unk> ’ s field . ”
And then , for that perchance no longer breath
Suffic ’ d him , of himself and of a <unk>
One group he made . Behind them was the wood
Full of black female <unk> , gaunt and fleet ,
As <unk> that have newly <unk> ’ d the <unk> .
On him , who <unk> down , they <unk> their fangs ,
And having rent him piecemeal bore away
The tortur ’ d limbs . My guide then seiz ’ d my hand ,
And led me to the <unk> , which in vain
Mourn ’ d through its bleeding wounds : “ O <unk>
Of <unk> ’ <unk> ! what avails it thee , ”
It cried , “ that of me thou hast made thy screen ?
For thy ill life what blame on me recoils ? ”
When o ’ er it he had paus ’ d , my master spake :
“ Say who wast thou , that at so many points
Breath ’ st out with blood thy lamentable speech ? ”
He answer ’ d : “ Oh , ye spirits : arriv ’ d in time
To spy the shameful havoc , that from me
My leaves hath sever ’ d thus , gather them up ,
And at the foot of their sad <unk>
<unk> lay them . In that city ’ I dwelt ,
Who for the Baptist her first <unk> chang ’ d ,
Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
To work her woe : and if there still remain ’ d not
On Arno ’ s passage some faint glimpse of him ,
Those citizens , who rear ’ d once more her walls
Upon the ashes left by Attila ,
Had labour ’ d without profit of their toil .
I <unk> the fatal <unk> from my own roof . ”
CANTO XIV
Soon as the charity of native land
<unk> in my bosom , I the scatter ’ d leaves
Collected , and to him restor ’ d , who now
Was hoarse with utt ’ rance . To the limit thence
We came , which from the third the second round
<unk> , and where of justice is display ’ d
<unk> horrible . Things then first seen
<unk> to manifest , I tell how next
A plain we reach ’ d , that from its <unk> bed
Each plant <unk> ’ d . The mournful wood waves round
Its garland on all sides , as round the wood
<unk> the sad foss . There , on the very edge ,
Our steps we stay ’ d . It was an <unk> wide
Of <unk> sand and thick , <unk> most
The soil that erst by Cato ’ s foot was trod .
Vengeance of Heav ’ n ! Oh ! how shouldst thou be fear ’ d
By all , who read what here my eyes beheld !
Of naked spirits many a flock I saw ,
All weeping piteously , to different laws
<unk> : for on the earth some lay <unk> ,
Some crouching close were seated , others pac ’ d
<unk> around ; the latter tribe ,
More numerous , those fewer who beneath
The torment lay , but <unk> in their grief .
O ’ er all the sand fell slowly <unk> down
<unk> flakes of fire , as flakes of snow
On Alpine summit , when the wind is <unk> ’ d .
As in the torrid Indian clime , the son
Of <unk> saw upon his <unk> band
Descending , solid flames , that to the ground
Came down : whence he <unk> him with his troop
To <unk> on the soil ; for easier thus
The vapour was extinguish ’ d , while alone ;
So fell the eternal fiery flood , wherewith
The marble glow ’ d underneath , as under <unk>
The <unk> , doubly to <unk> the pain .
<unk> was the play of wretched hands ,
Now this , now that way <unk> , to shake off
The heat , still falling fresh . I thus began :
“ Instructor ! thou who all things <unk> ’ st ,
Except the hardy demons , that rush ’ d forth
To <unk> our entrance at the gate , say who
Is yon huge spirit , that , as seems , <unk> not
The burning , but lies <unk> in proud scorn ,
As by the sultry tempest <unk> ’ d ? ”
Straight he himself , who was aware I ask ’ d
My guide of him , exclaim ’ d : “ Such as I was
When living , dead such now I am . If Jove
<unk> his workman out , from whom in ire
He snatch ’ d the <unk> , that at my last day
<unk> ’ d me , if the rest be weary out
At their black <unk> <unk> by turns
In <unk> , while he cries aloud ;
“ <unk> , help , good <unk> ! ” as erst he cried
In the <unk> warfare , and the <unk>
<unk> he full aim ’ d at me with all his might ,
He never should enjoy a sweet revenge . ”
Then thus my guide , in accent higher rais ’ d
Than I before had heard him : “ <unk> !
Thou art more punish ’ d , in that this thy pride
Lives yet unquench ’ d : no torrent , save thy rage ,
Were to thy fury pain proportion ’ d full . ”
Next turning round to me with milder lip
He spake : “ This of the seven kings was one ,
Who girt the Theban walls with <unk> , and held ,
As still he seems to hold , God in disdain ,
And sets his high <unk> at nought .
But , as I told him , his despiteful mood
Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it .
Follow me now ; and look thou set not yet
Thy foot in the <unk> sand , but to the wood
<unk> ever close . ” <unk> on we pass ’ d
To where there <unk> from the forest ’ s bound
A little brook , whose crimson ’ d wave yet lifts
My hair with horror . As the rill , that runs
From <unk> , to be portion ’ d out
Among the sinful women ; so ran this
Down through the sand , its bottom and each bank
<unk> , and either <unk> at its side ,
Whereon I straight perceiv ’ d our passage lay .
“ Of all that I have shown thee , since that gate
We enter ’ d first , whose threshold is to none
<unk> , nought else so worthy of regard ,
As is this river , has thine eye discern ’ d ,
O ’ er which the <unk> volley all is quench ’ d . ”
So spake my guide ; and I him thence besought ,
That having giv ’ n me appetite to know ,
The food he too would give , that hunger crav ’ d .
“ In midst of ocean , ” forthwith he began ,
“ A <unk> country lies , which Crete is nam ’ d ,
Under whose monarch in old times the world
<unk> ’ d pure and chaste . A mountain rises there ,
Call ’ d <unk> , joyous once with leaves and streams ,
<unk> now like a forbidden thing .
It was the spot which <unk> , Saturn ’ s spouse ,
<unk> for the secret <unk> of her son ;
And better to conceal him , <unk> ’ d in <unk>
His infant cries . Within the mount , upright
An ancient form there stands and huge , that turns
His shoulders towards <unk> , and at Rome
As in his mirror looks . Of <unk> gold
His head is shap ’ d , pure silver are the breast
And arms ; thence to the middle is of <unk> .
And downward all beneath <unk> ’ d steel ,
Save the right foot of <unk> ’ s clay , on which
Than on the other more erect he stands ,
Each part except the gold , is rent throughout ;
And from the <unk> tears <unk> , which join ’ d
<unk> to that cave . They in their course
Thus far <unk> down the rock
Form Acheron , and <unk> , and Phlegethon ;
Then by this straiten ’ d channel passing hence
Beneath , e ’ en to the lowest depth of all ,
Form there Cocytus , of whose lake ( thyself
Shall see it ) I here give thee no account . ”
Then I to him : “ If from our world this <unk>
Be thus deriv ’ d ; wherefore to us but now
<unk> it at this edge ? ” He straight replied :
“ The place , thou know ’ st , is round ; and though great part
Thou have already pass ’ d , still to the left
Descending to the nethermost , not yet
Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb .
Wherefore if aught of new to us appear ,
It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks . ”
Then I again inquir ’ d : “ Where flow the streams
Of Phlegethon and Lethe ? for of one
Thou tell ’ st not , and the other of that shower ,
Thou say ’ st , is form ’ d . ” He answer thus return ’ d :
“ <unk> thy questions all well pleas ’ d I hear .
Yet the red seething wave might have resolv ’ d
One thou <unk> . Lethe thou shalt see ,
But not within this hollow , in the place ,
Whither to <unk> themselves the spirits go ,
Whose blame hath been by penitence remov ’ d . ”
He added : “ Time is now we quit the wood .
Look thou my steps pursue : the margins give
Safe passage , <unk> by the flames ;
For over them all vapour is <unk> . ”
CANTO XV
One of the solid margins bears us now
<unk> ’ d in the mist , that from the stream
<unk> , <unk> o ’ er , and saves from fire
Both <unk> and water . As the <unk> rear
Their mound , ’ twixt Ghent and Bruges , to chase back
The ocean , <unk> his <unk> tide
That drives toward them , or the <unk> theirs
Along the <unk> , to <unk> their <unk>
And castles , ere the <unk> warmth be felt
On <unk> ’ s top ; such were the <unk> ,
So fram ’ d , though not in height or bulk to these
Made equal , by the master , whosoe ’ er
He was , that rais ’ d them here . We from the wood
Were not so far remov ’ d , that turning round
I might not have discern ’ d it , when we met
A troop of spirits , who came beside the pier .
They each one ey ’ d us , as at <unk>
One eyes another under a new moon ,
And toward us sharpen ’ d their sight as keen ,
As an old <unk> at his needle ’ s eye .
Thus <unk> explor ’ d by all the tribe ,
I was agniz ’ d of one , who by the <unk>
Caught me , and cried , “ What wonder have we here ! ”
And I , when he to me outstretch ’ d his arm ,
Intently fix ’ d my ken on his parch ’ d looks ,
That although <unk> ’ d with fire , they hinder ’ d not
But I remember ’ d him ; and towards his face
My hand inclining , answer ’ d : “ Sir ! Brunetto !
“ And art thou here ? ” He thus to me : “ My son !
Oh let it not <unk> thee , if Brunetto
<unk> but a little space with thee
Turn back , and leave his fellows to proceed . ”
I thus to him replied : “ Much as I can ,
I thereto pray thee ; and if thou be willing ,
That I here seat me with thee , I consent ;
His leave , with whom I journey , first obtain ’ d . ”
“ O son ! ” said he , “ whoever of this throng
One instant stops , lies then a hundred years ,
No fan to <unk> him , when the fire
Smites <unk> . Pass thou therefore on . I close
Will at thy garments walk , and then rejoin
My troop , who go mourning their endless doom . ”
I dar ’ d not from the path descend to tread
On equal ground with him , but held my head
Bent down , as one who walks in reverent guise .
“ What chance or destiny , ” thus he began ,
“ Ere the last day <unk> thee here below ?
And who is this , that shows to thee the way ? ”
“ There up aloft , ” I answer ’ d , “ in the life
<unk> , I wander ’ d in a valley lost ,
Before mine age had to its fullness reach ’ d .
But <unk> I left it : then once more
Into that vale returning , him I met ;
And by this path homeward he leads me back . ”
“ If thou , ” he answer ’ d , “ follow but thy star ,
Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven :
Unless in fairer days my judgment err ’ d .
And if my fate so early had not chanc ’ d ,
<unk> the heav ’ ns thus <unk> to thee , I
Had gladly giv ’ n thee comfort in thy work .
But that <unk> and malignant race ,
Who in old times came down from Fesole ,
Ay and still <unk> of their rough <unk> ,
Will for thy good deeds shew thee <unk> .
Nor wonder ; for amongst <unk> ’ d <unk>
It suits not the sweet <unk> lay her fruit .
Old fame reports them in the world for blind ,
<unk> , envious , proud . Look to it well :
Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways . For thee
Thy fortune hath such honour in <unk> ,
That thou by either party shalt be crav ’ d
With hunger keen : but be the fresh herb far
From the goat ’ s <unk> . The herd of Fesole
May of themselves make litter , not touch the plant ,
If any such yet spring on their rank bed ,
In which the holy seed revives , <unk>
From those true Romans , who still there remain ’ d ,
When it was made the nest of so much ill . ”
“ Were all my wish fulfill ’ d , ” I straight replied ,
“ Thou from the <unk> of man ’ s nature yet
Hadst not been <unk> forth ; for in my mind
Is fix ’ d , and now strikes full upon my heart
The dear , benign , <unk> image , such
As thine was , when so lately thou didst teach me
The way for man to win eternity ;
And how I priz ’ d the lesson , it behooves ,
That , long as life endures , my tongue should speak ,
What of my fate thou tell ’ st , that write I down :
And with another text to comment on
For her I keep it , the celestial dame ,
Who will know all , if I to her arrive .
This only would I have thee clearly note :
That so my conscience have no plea against me ;
Do fortune as she list , I stand prepar ’ d .
Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear .
Speed fortune then her wheel , as <unk> her best ,
The <unk> his <unk> ; all things have their course . ”
Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
Turn ’ d himself back , then look ’ d at me and spake :
